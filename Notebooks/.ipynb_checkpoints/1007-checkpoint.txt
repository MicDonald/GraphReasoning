leading light of silicon nanotechnology.preface optoelectronics and photonics are playing an essential role in many aspects of daily life, including information and communication technologies, environmentaland green technologies, mechanical and chemical sensing, consumer electronics, and biomedicine. so far, the use of optical components in communication systems has been mainly limited to direct replacement of electrical cables by optical cables. with the continual increase in link bit rates, optical cables are now replacing electri- cal cables for shorter and shorter interconnect lengths. optoelectronic and photonictechnologies are becoming less costly and more integrated, and there is currently an opportunity for optics to move “inside the box” and change the interconnect topology at all levels. currently, most optoelectronic devices are fabricated as discrete components. this approach is based on serial (e.g., step-by-step) fabrication and packaging, and it makes optoelectronic technology drastically different compared to microelectron-ics, where the domination of parallel fabrication made possible ultra-large-scale integration with the price of individual devices below $10 −8. also, discrete assem- bly reduces the optoelectronic system reliability and decreases the manufacturingyield. additional complications arise due to materials issues: in microelectronics the major material is elemental si, while traditional semiconductor materials for opto- electronics are iii–v alloys with much more complex technological requirements.finally, optical waveguides and waveguide based devices are very bulky compared to electron devices; thus, the densities of electron devices in integrated circuits are many orders of magnitude greater compared to that in integrated optoelectronic systems. silicon photonics, where photonics devices are fabricated by using silicon or silicon compatible materials and where the manufacturing is based on the available microelectronics infrastructure, is emerging as the technology that can face all these challenges. the ﬁrst volume of this series of books on silicon photonics appeared in2004. we stated then that “this book is aimed at presenting the fascinating picture of the state of-the-art in silicon photonics and providing perspectives on what can be expected in the near future.” many of the visionary concepts reported there havebeen surpassed by reality. silicon photonics is booming and growing at an incredible pace with many breakthroughs appearing day by day. speed, integration density, active components, logic, nonlinear optics, etc., are all surpassed frontiers, which viiviii preface silicon photonics has continuously moved apart. at the beginning of the second decade of the new millennium, several devices enabled by silicon photonics arealready on the market and new ones are emerging day by day. due to the broad nature and importance of the topic, as well as the rapid progress in this ﬁeld, it is quite appropriate to publish this sequel to our ﬁrst book on silicon photonics in the springer topics in applied physics series. we envisaged this book as the second of a series of books on silicon photonics, i.e., we are willing to produce further books on this topic as the ﬁeld develops. the present book is focused on components and integration and opens with a chapter by yamada, which reviews the fundamental characteristics and basic appli- cations of such waveguides. some passive devices, such as branches and wavelengthﬁlters, and dynamic devices based on the thermo-optic effect or carrier plasma effect have been developed by using silicon photonic wire waveguides. these waveguides also offer an efﬁcient media for nonlinear optical functions, such as wavelengthconversion. their optical polarization characteristics can be a serious obstacle to some practical applications, but such difﬁculties can be eliminated by using a mono- lithically integrated polarization diversity system. chapter 2 by xu explores fur- ther the problems associated with mode polarization in waveguides. this chapter reviews the characteristics of silicon-on-insulator ridge waveguide birefringence, asgoverned by the waveguide cross-section geometry, the cladding stress level, and cladding thickness. typical stress levels in dielectric cladding ﬁlms such as sili- con dioxide and silicon nitride are such that the stress-induced birefringence is ofcomparable magnitude to the waveguide geometrical birefringence. hence the total waveguide birefringence can be precisely controlled by counter balancing these two factors. the application of this technique for achieving polarization independenceand polarization splitting in photonic components is described using passive and active tuning of the stress-induced birefringence. in chapter 3 roelkens and van thourhout elaborate on the use of diffraction gratings to achieve an efﬁcient, com-pact, alignment-tolerant, polarization-independent, and broadband optical coupling between an optical ﬁber and optoelectronic components. an optical probe based on a diffraction grating integrated on the facet of a single-mode ﬁber is describedthat enables testing individual components in a silicon-on-insulator nanophotonic integrated circuit. chapter 4 by chang et al. tackles the difﬁcult technical problem of providing on-chip light sources, which are a critical component for integrated silicon photonics but lag other photonic components in their level of development. erbium is an optical dopant that can be employed as a viable means for on-chip lightgeneration, which also has the advantage of being compatible with long-distance telecommunications transmission wavelengths. in this chapter, er-doped silicon- rich silicon nitride and er silicates are introduced as promising host materials forcompact on-chip light sources. germanium on silicon is an enabler of silicon pho- tonics as well as high-speed cmos electronics and recently germanium has played a signiﬁcant role in integrating materials such as iii–vs on silicon. in chapter 5 ichikawa et al. describe an ultra-thin germanium buffer layer technology that has created entirely new ﬁelds for applications such as high-efﬁciency cost-effective tandem solar cells using silicon as the cell as well as the mechanical substrate. suchpreface ix solar cells have successfully reproduced their ideal external quantum efﬁciency and prove that it is possible to successfully integrate silicon and gaas. the remaining four chapters focus on system integration. first, scandurra in chapter 6 describes possible applications of silicon photonics to the system-on- chip (soc) domain. the higher and higher integration density is becoming suchthat many issues arise when a soc has to be integrated, and electrical limits of interconnect wires are a limiting factor for performance that could be overcome through the use of the optical interconnect. today, many semiconductor indus-tries are investigating such a novel ﬁeld and a number of projects are currently in progress to demonstrate the feasibility of such a revolutionary on-chip communica- tion system relying on both cmos technology and photonics. chapter 7 develops this concept further. liao et al. highlight a recent demonstration of a silicon pho- tonic integrated chip that is capable of transmitting data at an aggregate rate of 200 gb/s. it is based on wavelength division multiplexing where an array of eighthigh-speed silicon optical modulators is monolithically integrated with a demul- tiplexer and a multiplexer. this demonstration represents a key milestone on the way to fabricating terabit per second transceiver chips to meet future demands. in chapter 8 pinguet et al. describe the intimate relationship between process, devices, and system design by examining the development of luxtera’s cmos photon-ics technology. they address the challenges of integrating optoeletronic elements, including germanium photodiodes, in a commercial cmos process without sig- niﬁcantly affecting the electronics performance and the manufacturability of theprocess. a complete monolithically integrated wavelength division multiplexed 40- gbps transceiver chip is fabricated as an example of the application of their complete technology platform and to demonstrate its capabilities for optoelectronic integra-tion. lastly, fedeli et al. in chapter 9 address different ways to merge photonics devices on an electronic circuit with microelectronics tools on large size wafers. the preferred route is above-integrated-circuit fabrication, with two options ruledby thermal constraints. the high-temperature option is based on wafer bonding on an optical silicon-on-insulator module, and the low-temperature option relies on the heterogeneous integration of iii–v devices. finally, we dedicate this book to the memory of ulrich gösele (1949–2009), our colleague who recently and prematurely passed away. he was among the ﬁrst who initiated the ﬁeld by discovering the quantum nature of porous silicon and the possibility of its use in optoelectronics. moreover, he pioneered the tech- nique of wafer bonding, which is nowadays a common practice to realize hybriddevices. ottawa, canada david j. lockwood trento, italy lorenzo

5 1chapter 1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications koji yamada abstract this chapter reviews the fundamental characteristics and basic applica- tions of the silicon photonic wire waveguide. thanks to its ultra-small geometrical structures and compatibility with the silicon electronics, the silicon photonic wire waveguide provides us with a highly integrated platform for electronic–photonicconvergence. for the practical achievement of this platform, however, we must search for ways to reduce the propagation loss and coupling loss to external ﬁbers and overcome the polarization dependence. progress has been made by applying state-of-the-art technologies specially tuned to the fabrication of nanometer struc- tures, and the fundamental propagation performance has already become a practi-cal standard. some passive devices, such as branches and wavelength ﬁlters, and dynamic devices based on the thermo-optic effect or carrier plasma effect have been developed by using silicon photonic wire waveguides. these waveguides also offeran efﬁcient media for nonlinear optical functions, such as wavelength conversion. although polarization dependence remains a serious obstacle to the practical appli- cations of these waveguides, waveguide-based polarization manipulation devicesprovide us with effective solutions, such as a polarization diversity system. 1.1 introduction in recent years, silicon photonics has attracted attention as an emerging technologyfor optical telecommunications and for optical interconnects in microelectronics.based on highly sophisticated silicon semiconductor technology, silicon photonics would provide us with an inexpensive highly integrated electronic–photonic plat- form, in which ultra-compact photonic devices and electronic circuits are converged. similar to the existing silica-based or iii–v semiconductor-based photonic sys- tems, silicon photonics also requires an optical waveguide system. the waveguide k.

wavelength ﬁlters and modulators. the waveguide system must alsobe ﬂexible enough to allow active functions, such as light emission and detection to be implemented. of course, it should guarantee a sufﬁciently low propagation loss for constructing and integrating these photonic functions. furthermore, formonolithic electronic–photonic convergence, the most important advantage of sili- con photonics, the following requirements must be met: (1) waveguides should be constructed on silicon substrates or be constructed together with silicon electronic devices. (2) waveguide fabrication processes should not damage electronic devices. (3) waveguides should not be damaged by the processes for fabricating electronic devices. (4) waveguide materials must not be hazardous to silicon electronics. (5) geometrical criteria, such as the layout of photonic devices, should not interfere with the electronic circuit layout. these requirements are very difﬁcult to meet with conventional waveguide sys- tems. for example, the fabrication process for conventional silica-based waveguide requires high temperatures exceeding 1,000 ◦c, which would seriously damage elec- tronic devices. moreover, silica-based waveguides have a large bending radius on the order of millimeters or even centimeters, making it impossible to integrate pho- tonic circuits on an electronic chip, whose typical size is a few centimeters square.the iii–v compound semiconductor-based waveguides and photonic devices have geometries smaller than those in the silica-based system; however, on a silicon sub- strate it is very difﬁcult to epitaxially grow the high-quality iii–v materials neededfor the construction of practical photonic devices. etching and other fabrication pro- cedures are completely different from silicon processes. moreover, iii–v material contamination must be eliminated from silicon electronics. at present, it is thereforevery difﬁcult to introduce iii–v compounds into silicon electronics. polymer waveg- uides made of organic materials cause less damage to electronic devices. however, their use is limited to the uppermost layers formed after the electronic circuits are completed or to other regions separated from the electronic devices because they cannot withstand the temperatures used in electronic device fabrication. recently, silicon oxynitride (sion) and silicon nitride (si 3n4) waveguides have also been proposed as a compact waveguide system [ 1,2]; however, these silicon nitride waveguides might be not suitable for electronic–photonic convergence forinfrared light at wavelengths around 1,500 nm. silicon nitride materials formed by low-temperature deposition methods generally contain n–h bond residues, which readily absorb infrared light at around 1,500 nm. a high-temperature (1,000 ◦co r more) annealing can reduce the absorption, but the high-temperature process is not compatible with electronic devices. from the viewpoint of material, a silicon-based waveguide is obviously prefer- able for electronic photonic convergence. so far, several types of silicon waveguides have been proposed such as rib-type waveguides with core dimensions of a few micrometers [ 3,4] and photonic wire waveguides with core dimensions of several1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications 3 hundreds of nanometers [ 5–10]. the latter are especially promising for electronic– photonic convergence because their ultra-small core dimensions and micrometer bending sections match the dimensions of electronic circuits. the waveguides are constructed on silicon-on-insulator (soi) substrates, where the uppermost soi layer is used as the waveguide core so that there is no need to form the core material. the cladding material is a silica-based material formed by a low-temperature process such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (pe–cvd) [ 11]. besides the advantages of silicon photonic wire waveguides in electronic– photonic convergence, highly integrated ultra-compact photonic circuits based on photonic wire waveguides guarantee low power consumption and low packaging cost. furthermore, the waveguides also offer advanced functionality through the use of its semiconductor characteristics of silicon. 1.2 fundamental design of silicon photonic wire waveguides 1.2.1 guided modes a schematic of s silicon photonic wire waveguide is shown in fig. 1.1a. the waveg- uide consist of a silicon core and silica-based cladding. the core dimension should be determined so that a single-mode condition is fulﬁlled. the single-mode condi- tion is very important in constructing practical functional devices because whether or not we can implement a desired function depends on the fundamental guided mode. the core dimension of single-mode silicon photonic wire waveguides is sig- niﬁcantly smaller than that of conventional single-mode silica waveguides. in the waveguide system consisting of a silicon core and silica claddings, the refractive sio2 undercladding (n = 1.44)siox/sion overcladding (n ~ 1.51) silicon core: 460  × 200  nm (n = 3.48) silicon substrate normalized intensity (a.u.) 00.20.40.60.811.2

optical intensity distribution of a typical silicon pho- tonic wire waveguide4 k. yamada index contrast /delta1between the core and cladding is as large as 40%, which allows a total internal reﬂection with a very large incident angle of 60◦. this situation is similar to that in metallic rectangular waveguides, whose waveguide dimensions are smaller than or comparable to a half-wavelength of the guided electromag- netic waves. in silicon photonic wire waveguides, therefore, the core dimensionthat fulﬁlls a single-mode condition should also be smaller than or comparable to a half-wavelength of a guided wave in silicon. since the refractive index of silicon is about 3.5 for photon energies below the band-gap energy, the core dimension ofa silicon photonic wire waveguide should be less than or comparable to 400 nm for 1,310∼1,550-nm telecommunications-band infrared light. generally, the core shape is made ﬂat along the substrate to reduce the etching depth in practical fabrications.in many cases, the height of the core is typically half of the width. thus, a typical core geometry is a 400 ×200-nm 2rectangle. a detailed analysis of the guided modes can be performed by various numerical methods such as the ﬁnite difference method (fdm) [ 12], ﬁnite element method (fem) [ 13], and ﬁlm mode matching method (fmm) [ 14]. figures 1.2a and b show calculated effective indices neffof guided modes for 1,550-nm infrared light in var- ious core geometries. calculations were performed by the fmm and the indices of silicon and silica were set at 3.477 and 1.444, respectively. the mode notations aretaken from [ 15], in which e xand eymodes represent the transverse electric (te)- like and transverse magnetic (tm)-like modes, respectively. as shown fig. 1.2a for waveguides of 200-nm silicon thickness, single-mode conditions are fulﬁlledwhen the core width is less than 460 nm for te-like guided modes in which the dominant electric ﬁeld is parallel to the substrate. the mode

fulﬁlled in a core larger than that for the te-like mode. the effective indices of te and tm fundamental modes show a large difference. in other words, the 200-nm-thick ﬂat core produces a large polarization dependence. for waveguides with 300-nm-thick silicon as shown in fig. 1.2b, core widths satis- fying single-mode conditions are smaller than those for 200-nm-thick silicon. in a 300-nm2core, the refractive indices are identical for the te and tm fundamental modes: that is, the polarization dependence can be eliminated. figure 1.3shows the calculated wavelength dependence of the effective refractive indices for the waveguides with a 400 ×200-nm2core. calculations were performed by the fmm and the material dispersions of refractive indices were considered. as shown in fig. 1.3, the single-mode condition is violated in the wavelength region below 1,420 nm for the te-like mode. for the 1,310-nm telecommunications wave-length band, therefore, a smaller core should be used for satisfying the single-mode condition. 1.2.2 effect of geometrical errors and birefringence as shown in fig. 1.2, the effective indices of silicon photonic wire waveguide are extremely sensitive to the core geometries. the group index ng, which is an essential parameter in designing delay-based devices such as optical ﬁlters, is also affected signiﬁcantly by the core geometry. figures 1.4a and b show calculated group indices and their sensitivities to the core width dng/ngdw. for te-like modes, for which most of the photonic functions are designed, the sensitivities to the core width dng/ngdware around 2 ×10−4nm−1for a 400 ×200-nm2core and much higher for a 300-nm2core. for wavelength ﬁlters for dense wavelength division multiplex- ing (dwdm), the group index should be controlled to on the order of 1 ×10−4 or less. the index restriction corresponds to a core width accuracy of 0.5 nm or less, which is essentially unattainable with current micro-fabrication technology. fortunately, there are optimum geometries giving very low sensitivities to the core width. for example, 385 ×200-nm2and 325 ×300-nm2cores are robust against the errors in core width. waveguides with a very wide core are also robust against the errors in core width. in an arrayed waveguide grating (awg) ﬁlter, waveguides with 750 ×200-nm2cores are used to reduce phase errors due to the variation of6 k. yamada ex11 ey11 ex11 ey111.5 1.0 0.5 0 −0.5 −1.0 −1.5 −2.02.02.53.03.54.04.5group index ng5.0(a) dng ng dw × 103 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 core width (nm) 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 −0.5 −1.0 −1.5

a wide-core waveguide, however, higher order modes stimulated in bending and other asymmetric structures become a concern. figure 1.4also that the structural birefringence is incredibly large and that the problem of the polarization dependence in a silicon photonic wire waveguide is practically unsolvable. in a waveguide with a 400 ×200-nm2core, the group indices are 4.33 for the te-like fundamental mode and 2.78 for the tm-like fundamental1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications 7 mode. the difference in the group indices gives a polarization mode dispersion (pmd) of 51.7 ps/cm, which seriously limits the applicable bandwidth in high-speeddata transmission. the polarization-dependent wavelength (pd λ) in delay-based ﬁl- ter devices, such as awgs and ring resonators, would be incredibly large. a square core would not be a solution to this problem because the group index is very sensi-tive to the core geometry, as mentioned before. in other words, polarization diversity is necessary for eliminating the polarization dependence in photonic devices based on silicon photonic wire waveguides. 1.2.3 propagation loss and radiation loss in bending the intrinsic loss in undoped silicon is very low for the photon energies below theband gap ( ∼1.1 ev); therefore, the propagation loss of photonic wire waveguides is mainly determined by scattering due to surface roughness of the core. the effect of the surface roughness on the scattering loss in dielectric waveguides has been theoretically studied and formulated by payne and lacey [ 17]. the formula is rep- resented by a complicated function characterized by a root-mean square roughness σand the correlation length of the surface roughness structure l c; the upper bound of the scattering loss αmax,a sg i v e ni n[ 18], is shown below. αmax=σ2κ k0d4n1, (1.1) where, k0,d, and n1are wavevector of the light in vacuum, the half-width of the core, and effective index of a silicon slab with the same thickness as the core, respectively. the factor κdepends on the waveguide geometry and the statistical distribution (gaussian, exponential, etc.) of the roughness, in which the correlationlength l cis included. according to [ 17],κis on the order of unity for most prac- tical waveguide geometries. thus, the scattering loss is inversely proportional to the fourth power of d. in other words, it will seriously increase in photonic wire waveguides with an ultra-small core. a roughness of only 5 nm, for instance, would cause a 60-db/cm scattering loss in a 400-nm-wide core made of a 200-nm-thicksilicon slab whose effective index is 2.7. to achieve a practical scattering loss of a few decibels per centimeter, the surface roughness should be about 1 nm or less. radiation losses in the bending section can be calculated by applying cylindrical coordinates in numerical mode solvers. figure 1.5shows calculated radiation losses for a 90 ◦bend in various waveguides. the calculations were performed by using a commercially available fmm mode solver [ 19]. as shown in this ﬁgure, the bending performance varies with polarization. for the te-like mode in the waveguide with a 400×200-nm2core, the radiation loss is negligible even if the bending radius is as small as 2.5 μm. for the tm-like mode, however, a bending radius of over a few tens of micrometers is needed in order to achieve negligible radiation loss. the bending loss also varies with core dimensions. as shown in fig. 1.5, for te-like modes, a waveguide with a 300-nm2core requires a larger bending radius than a ﬂat waveguide.8 k. yamada fig. 1.5 calculated radiation losses for a 90◦bend in various waveguides −0.010.000.010.020.030.040.05 1 10 100bending loss (db/90 deg.) bending radius ( μm)te

for connecting it to external circuits such as single-mode optical ﬁbers. a highly efﬁcient spot size converter (ssc) with a silicon reverse adiabatic taper has already been proposed [ 20]. as shown in fig. 1.6, it has a double- core structure consisting of a thin silicon taper and silica-based waveguides. in atypical design for 1,550-nm-wavelength infrared light, the tip of the taper should be ultimately reduced to less than 100 nm and the silica-based waveguide has a 3- μm 2 core with a 2.5% index contrast to the cladding. in such a double-core structure, light leaking from the silicon taper is captured by a silica-based waveguide, which guarantees efﬁcient optical coupling to external optical ﬁbers. figure 1.7shows the calculated conversion efﬁciencies between a silicon pho- tonic wire waveguide with a 400 ×200-nm2core and a silica-based waveguide with a3 -μm2core. as shown in this ﬁgure, a 200- μm-long taper with a 80-nm tip gives a conversion loss of around 0.1 db for both polarizations. a shorter and thickertaper would give lower coupling efﬁciencies. since the coupling loss between a silica-based waveguide with a 3- μm 2core and a high-numerical-aperture (na) ﬁber with a 4.3- μm mode ﬁeld diameter is about 0.1 db and the conversion loss between fig. 1.6 schematic of the spot size converter high- δ  silica-based waveguide: 3 × 3 μm coresilicon photonic wire

a single-mode ﬁber. a grating coupler input/output structure has also been proposed [ 22], for which the coupling efﬁciency between a photonic wire waveguide and an ordinary single- mode ﬁber is calculated to be −5t o−3d b . 1.3 fundamental propagation performance 1.3.1 fabrication figure 1.8shows a typical fabrication process for a si-wire waveguide. first, a hard mask layer and resist mask layer are formed on a soi substrate. the hard mask is used to improve the selectivity of si etching and is often made of sio 2.n e x t , waveguide patterns are deﬁned by using electron beam (eb) lithography or excimer laser deep ultraviolet (duv) lithography [ 9], which are capable of forming 100-nm patterns. ordinarily, eb and duv lithography technologies are used in the fabri- cation of electronic circuits where they are optimized for patterning of straight and intersecting line patterns. therefore, no consideration has been given to curves androughness in the pattern edges, which are important factors in fabricating low-loss optical waveguides. to reduce propagation losses of the waveguides, it is necessary to reduce the edge roughness to around 1 nm or less. this means that particularcare must be taken in the data preparation for eb shots or duv masks. figure 1.9 shows an ultra-small ring resonator with and without special treatment for eb data preparation, where a drastic reduction in side-wall roughness is observed as a resultof the special treatment [ 23]. the writing speed of the eb lithography must also be considered in practical fabrication. for practical purposes, it is probably necessary to use eb lithography with a variable-shaped beam. after resist development and sio 2etching for a hard mask, the silicon core is formed by low-pressure plasma etching with an electron-cyclotron resonance (ecr) plasma or inductive coupled plasma. to ensure the edge roughness of the side walls10 k. yamada si substratesi on insulator (soi) layer eb/duv

must be tuned for individual plasma equipment. finally, an overcladding layer is formed with a sio 2-based material or poly- mer resin material. to avoid damaging the silicon layer, the cladding layers must be deposited by a low-temperature process, such as the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (pe–cvd) method [ 11]. in particular, for waveguides associated with electronic structure, it is essential to use a low-temperature process so as not to damage the electronic devices. figure 1.10a shows a scanning electron microscope (sem) image of the core of a silicon photonic wire waveguide with a cross-section of 400 ×200 nm2[8]. the geometrical shape closely matches the design values, and the perpendicularity of the sidewalls is also very good. figure 1.10b shows a photograph

( a) core of silicon photonic wire waveguide, ( b) silicon taper, and ( c) core of siox waveguide for spot size converter taper tip in the ssc. the taper and waveguide core were constructed by using a common fabrication process. figure 1.10c shows an sem photograph of the core of the silica waveguide for the ssc. the silica waveguide core was fabricated by depositing sio 2-based material by the pe–cvd method and etched by reactive ion etching (rie). by adjusting the deposition conditions, the refractive index of the material is tuned to be 2.5% higher than that of an ordinary thermal oxide. in the ﬁnal product, a 7- μms i o 2overcladding layer covers the whole structure. 1.3.2 propagation performance figure 1.11 shows a typical transmission loss of silicon photonic wire waveguides with ssc, fabricated in the manner mentioned above. high-na optical ﬁbers with 4.3-μm mode ﬁeld diameter (mfd) are used for external coupling. as shown in this ﬁgure, the propagation loss for the te-like mode has been improved to be around 1 db/cm. in the waveguide with ﬂat cores, the propagation losses for tm-like modes are generally better than those for te-like modes. oxidation of the core sidewalls may further reduce the propagation losses [ 24]. the propagation loss of around 1 db/cm is already at a practical level, since photonic devices based on siliconphotonic wire waveguides are typically smaller than 1 mm. besides the sidewall fig. 1.11 measured propagation loss of a silicon photonic wire waveguide with spot size converters–12–10–8–6–4–20transmittance (db) waveguide length

well. figure 1.12 shows the relation between measured propagation losses and core widths. as shown, the propagation loss is reduced by increasing the core width because the effect ofsidewall roughness is reduced in a wide core. when the core width exceeds 460 nm, the waveguide can also guide a higher order mode which may degrade the perfor- mances of some photonic devices. the coupling loss between optical ﬁber and silicon photonic wire waveguide is represented by the intercept of the vertical axis in fig. 1.11. the loss value at the intercept includes two waveguide/ﬁber interfaces; therefore in this case, one interface has a 0.5 db coupling loss at a wavelength of 1,550 nm. figure 1.13 shows the transmission spectrum of a silicon photonic wire waveg- uide with sscs. the spectrum remains ﬂat over a 200-nm wide bandwidth, and no absorption dip is observed. the ﬂat spectrum means that the sio 2-based mate- rial used in the ssc does not contain impurities with n–h bonds. althoughabsorption by residual o–h bonds exists at wavelengths of around 1,400 nm, the resulting losses are not large. it is also possible to eliminate o–h bonds by heat treatment. figure 1.14 shows bending losses of single mode waveguides for te-like modes. for the bending radius of over 5 μm, bending losses are negligible. even for an ultra-small bending radius of around 2 μm, a waveguide with a ﬂat core

square core shows a larger bending loss for a bending radius below 5 μm. for tm-like modes, especially in waveguides with ﬂat cores, bending losses are generally larger than those for te-like modes. bending losses measured in various research groups are summarized in [10]. the birefringence of the waveguide can be evaluated by the free spectral ranges (fsrs) of ring resonators. figure 1.15 shows measured transmission spectra at around 197 thz (λ=1.514μm)for a ring resonator of 10- μm radius. in this ﬁgure, the fsr in tm-like modes (1.67 thz) is signiﬁcantly larger than that in te-like modes (1.11 thz). using the fsr, we can roughly express the group indexof the waveguide by n g=c/2πrδf, where c,r, andδfare the speed of light in a vacuum, the radius of the ring resonator, and the fsr in hertz, respectively. thus, the group indices are estimated to be 4.30 and 2.86 for te and tm modes,respectively, which agree well with the design values in the previous section. fig. 1.15 measured

wire waveguides 1.4.1 passive devices the simplest passive device is a branch. various branching devices, such as a y branch and a multimode interference (mmi) branch, have been proposed and fabri- cated with silicon-wire waveguides [ 6,7]. figure 1.16a shows a multi-stage branch implemented with mmi branches [ 25]. the mmi branch units are no more than 3μm in size, and the waveguides can bend light with a micrometer radius, so it is easy to conﬁgure multi-stage branches in a small area. figure 1.16bs h o w st h e transmittance of the cascaded mmi branches for each output port. the transmittance linearly decreases with respect to the branching order. in other words, the branches of each stage are fabricated with uniform quality. compact add/drop wavelength ﬁlters are also being developed by using the ultra- compact bending parts of silicon-wire waveguides. various ring-resonator-basedﬁlters have been developed. a single resonator is very compact and suitable for high-density integration; however, its lorentzian resonance, as shown in fig. 1.15, is not suitable for ﬁlters for telecommunications applications, which require ﬂatpass bands. for a ﬂat pass band, cascaded ring resonators have recently been devel- oped [ 26]. complex wavelength ﬁlters, such awg ﬁlters [ 16,27] and the lattice ﬁlters [28,29], have also been developed. a photograph of a lattice ﬁlter is shown in fig. 1.17a. in such ﬁlters, the pass-band spectrum can be ﬁne-tuned by applying various optimization techniques, such as apodization. as shown in fig. 1.17b, for fig. 1.16 (a) cascaded mmi branches

apodization of the coupling coefﬁcients in the directional couplers has been performed [ 29]. the shape of the pass band could also be controlled by apodization in these sophisticated ﬁlters. wavelength tuning and polarization dependence are serious obstacles to the prac- tical applications of these wavelength ﬁlters. as shown in the previous sections, effective indices of silicon photonic wire waveguides are extremely sensitive togeometrical errors in the core shape. the indices are also sensitive to the envi- ronmental temperature. therefore, index tuning by temperature control or carrier injection is necessary for ﬁxing the pass band to a certain wavelength. as describedin the previous sections, the structural birefringence is also very sensitive to the core geometry, and it is virtually impossible to eliminate the polarization dependence of passive devices based on silicon photonic wire waveguides. a practical solution for the polarization dependence is the polarization diversity, whose details are described in sect. 1.5. 1.4.2 dynamic devices 1.4.2.1 thermo-optic effect the thermo-optic (to) effect in silicon is ten times or more stronger than that in silica [ 30] and the volume of the core in silicon photonic wire waveguides is smaller than that of the core in silica-based waveguides. therefore, power consumption insilicon-based to devices can be one-tenth of that in silica-based devices. to achieve such a low power consumption, it is very important to concentrate the heating power in the waveguide core. however, heat expansion in the thick ( ∼3μm) and laterally16 k. yamada wide cladding layer is an obstacle to the heat convergence. in the early applications of the to effect in optical switches based on mach-zehndar interferometers (mzis),heaters were constructed on a thick overcladding without lateral thermal insulation. in such to switches, a few tens of milliwatts of heater power is necessary for aπphase shift in one arm of a mzi [ 11]. compared to typical silica-based to switches, silicon-based devices without an efﬁcient heating structure do not show a remarkable improvement in power consumption. recently, a very efﬁcient heat- ing structure has been proposed. figure 1.18 shows a cross-sectional schematic of the heating structure. in the heating structure, the undercladding and side-cladding are removed and only a several-micrometer-wide silica cladding containing a sil- icon core is supported by thin silica beams [ 31]. by applying this structure as a phase shifter in mzis, the heating power has been reduced to be less than 1 mw, as shown in fig. 1.19, which is about 1/100th of that of conventional silica-based to switches. 1.4.2.2 carrier injection in the infrared and visible regions, the optical properties of silicon are affected by free carriers, especially for photon energies below the band gap ( ∼1.1 ev). by applying the drude approximation and assuming the carrier plasma frequency is fig.

respectively. to control the concentration of free carriers in the waveguide core, silicon pho- tonic wire waveguides with a p-i-n carrier injection structure have been developed[33–35]. a typical cross-section of a waveguide with a p-i-n carrier injection struc- ture is shown in fig. 1.20a. the typical core size of waveguides with a p-i-n structure is 400–600 ×200 nm 2. at both sides of the core, the waveguide has slab regions for carrier injection. although the core shape resembles that of conventional silicon rib waveguides [ 3], its geometrical size is far smaller than in the conventional ones. moreover, the bending radius is less than a hundredth of that in conventional rib waveguides. these reductions in geometries are greatly advantageous for appli- cations of silicon photonic wire waveguides with the carrier injection structures.for example, the device length would be signiﬁcantly reduced because the carrier concentration can be increased in an ultra-small core. in such a short device with an ultra-small core, the electric power consumption can be signiﬁcantly reduced.moreover, the operation speed can also be increased because a small core guarantees a fast carrier transit time. by applying these advantages of silicon photonic wire waveguides with p-i-n structures, various dynamic devices, such as high-speed modulators [ 33,35] and variable optical attenuators (voa) [ 34], have been developed. among them, in this section, the application of the p-i-n carrier injection structure to a voa is described.18 k. yamada n+  p+ waveguide al electrode

slab is thicker than those reported in [ 33] and [ 35]. the thick slab is important for reducing propagation loss and device impedance. the core was fabricated in same manner as for passive waveguides. after ther- mal oxidation for surface passivation, the n+and p+regions were deﬁned in the slab section by lithography and implanted with phosphorus and boron as dopants. after annealing for the activation and diffusion of dopants, a silicon dioxide layer was deposited. the dopant density was about 1020cm−3in each doped region. alu- minum electrodes were then constructed on the doped regions. figure 1.20b shows a fabricated waveguide with the carrier injection structure in which the pair of contact electrodes can be seen. the propagation loss is typically less than 2 db/cm. figure 1.21 shows typical electrical characteristics of a 1-mm- long carrier injection structure. in spite of the device length, the reverse current isvery low, around pico-amperes. this means the leakage of the device is small, so that injected carriers will effectively interact with guided light. fig. 1.21 measured current-voltage relation of the carrier injection structure10–2 10–4 10–6 10–8 10–10

tion can be reduced by a series connection of the devices, which is a similar to thetechnique used in conventional devices. figure 1.23 shows the temporal response of optical attenuation in a

these values can satisfy required practical standards. 1.4.3 nonlinear functions in addition to its use as a platform for passive and dynamic functions, a silicon photonic wire waveguide is also a promising platform for active functions based on20 k. yamada various nonlinear effects. generally, bulk silicon shows weak nonlinearities. in sili- con photonic wire waveguides, however, the optical power density can be increasedin their ultra-small cores and nonlinear effects can be remarkably enhanced. the typ- ical core size of the waveguide is 400–500 ×200 nm 2at 1,550-nm wavelength, and the effective mode-ﬁeld area aeffis around 0.05 μm2[36]. thanks to the ultra-small effective area, the kerr nonlinear coefﬁcient γin silicon photonic wire waveguides is thus estimated to be 105–106(w km)−1. this value is about a hundred-thousand times larger than that for a single-mode dispersion-shifted ﬁber (dsf), which is awidely used media for nonlinear optics experiments. in other words, a centimeter- long silicon photonic wire waveguide is equivalent to a 100-m long dsf, giving practical efﬁciencies in various nonlinear functions. although the interaction lengthand efﬁcient power injection have been obstacles to obtaining practical efﬁciencies, the propagation loss of the waveguides has recently been improved to be 1–2 db/cm and the coupling loss to external ﬁbers has been reduced to be 0.5 db by using aspecial ssc [ 20]. thus, a power density of around 300 mw/cm 2could be attained using commercially available 20-dbm cw light sources. the power density is high enough to obtain efﬁcient nonlinear functions. by applying the enhancement of nonlinear effects in a silicon photonic wire waveguide, various nonlinear functions, such as all-optical modulation based onthe two photon absorption (tpa) effect [ 37], wavelength conversion and parametric ampliﬁcation based on four wave mixing (fwm) effects [ 36,38,39] and stimulated raman scattering (srs) [ 4,40], have been tested. very recently, entangled-photon- pair creation has also been tested by using spontaneous fwm [ 41–43]. among these functions, fwm-based wavelength conversion is here described as a typical nonlinear function giving an efﬁciency comparable to that in conventionaldevices [ 38]. the experimental setup for the wavelength conversion is shown in fig. 1.24. a signal light with 10-gbps non-return-to-zero (nrz) modulation and a cw-operated pump light were injected collinearly into a 2.8-cm-long waveguidewith sscs. the polarization was adjusted to a te-like mode, and the propagation loss of the waveguide was about 2.3 db/cm. at the waveguide’s entrance, the pump fig. 1.24 experimental setup for wavelength conversion using the four-wave mixing effect1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications 21 fig. 1.25 experimental result of wavelength conversionusing the four-wave mixingeffect power was 160 mw cw, which gives a power density of around 430 mw/cm2in the waveguide. the output spectrum at the exit of the waveguide is shown in fig. 1.25. besides the peaks of the injected pump and signal light, a peak of the phase conjugated light,or converted light, can be seen in the spectrum. the internal conversion efﬁciency is around −10 db [ 38], which is comparable to that observed in periodically poled linbo 3devices a few years ago [ 44], and large enough for practical data process- ing. as shown in fig. 1.26, clear eye patterns of a 10-gbps pseudorandom binary sequence (prbs) data stream are observed in the converted light. the bandwidth giving a −3-db efﬁciency degradation was measured to be over 20 nm [ 36]. the bandwidth was limited by the phase mismatching among waves. in silicon photonic wire waveguides, waveguide dispersion can be easily controlled by adjusting the core shape; therefore, the bandwidth could be further improved [ 39]. the conversion efﬁciency with respect to the pump power is shown in fig. 1.27. efﬁciency saturation due to the free carrier absorption effect can obviously be seen. the free carriers are generated through the tpa effect whose efﬁciency is propor-tional to the second power of the optical power density. therefore, the simplest way to eliminate fca is to reduce the power density. a theoretical estimation shows that a waveguide with 0.5-db/cm propagation loss (dashed line) would providean efﬁciency of −4 db even if the pump power were 80 mw, where fca is well suppressed [ 38]. carrier sweep-out using a p-i-n structure, such as described in the previous section, is also a promising way to prevent fca. fig. 1.26 eye pattern of the signal of phase conjugated light100 ps22 k. yamada fig. 1.27 internal conversion efﬁciency versus pump powerin wavelength conversion.the

most seri- ous obstacles to the practical application of silicon photonic wire waveguides, and polarization diversity is a unique solution to this problem. generally, polarization diversity is achieved by using polarization splitters and rotators. if te-like andtm-like modes can be separated by polarization splitters, and the tm-like modes can be converted into te-like ones by rotators, we need only consider optical functions for the te-like modes, not for both components. thus, the polarization dependence could be eliminated by using a single-polarization (te) platform. such a polarization diversity system might be constructed by using free-space opticaldevices and optical ﬁbers; however, this would require too much area and would be costly. for the polarization diversity circuit to be practical, it should be monolithi- cally constructed on a chip. recently, two types of on-chip polarization diversitycircuits have been proposed [ 45,46]. one is based on a two-dimensional grat- ing coupler [ 45]. the other is based on a polarization splitter and rotator with silicon photonic wire waveguides [ 46]. details of the latter are described in this section. 1.5.1 polarization splitter and rotator a scanning-electron micrograph of the fabricated polarization splitter is shown infig. 1.28. this device is based on a simple directional coupler with silicon pho- tonic wire waveguides [ 47]. the coupling length for the tm-like modes is much shorter than for the te-like modes. thus, the tm-like modes can traverse thecoupler, whereas the te-like modes propagate along the initial waveguide. in a design for 1,550-nm infrared light, a directional coupler consisting of 200-nm-high and 400-nm-wide cores with a 480-nm gap can separate two orthogonal polariza-1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications 23 fig. 1.28 as e mi m a g eo f the polarization splitter tions through only a 10- μm-long propagation. for the suppression of additional coupling at the bending sections and for high-density integration, the ends of the coupler are tightly bent with a 3- μm radius. in the 200 ×400-nm2rectangular core, te-like modes can propagate through the tight bend, but tm-like modes can not. therefore, the exit waveguide for the tm-like modes is straight along the coupler. the measured transmission of the splitter for various incident polarizations is shown in fig. 1.29. the polarization was controlled by rotating a half-wave plate installed in front of the single-mode ﬁber for input. in the cross port, tm-like modes are dominant and te modes are suppressed; in the bar port, vice versa. the maxi- mum polarization extinction ratios (pers) are 26 and 14 db for bar and cross ports,respectively. cascading two splitters improves the per to about 23 db for the cross port. a detailed study has shows that the applicable bandwidth is over 100 nm for a −10 db per [ 47]. a schematic of the fabricated rotator is shown in fig. 1.30a[48]. the device has an off-axis double-core structure consisting of a 200-nm 2silicon core, a 840-nm2 silicon oxynitride (sion) core, and a silica overcladding. the right and bottom edges of the thin silicon core overlap the corresponding edges of the second core. the sion layer, with a refractive index of 1.60, and the silica layer are deposited by the pe–cvd method. fig. 1.29 measured transmission of a single-stage polarization splitter for various incident polarizations24 k. yamada fig. 1.30 (a) schematic of the polarization rotation structure and ( b) its eigenmodes as shown in fig. 1.30b, the double-core structure has two orthogonal eigen- modes with the eigenaxes tilted toward the substrate. thus, propagation through thewaveguide produces a rotation of the polarization plane when the polarization of incident light is just te-like or tm-like modes. the polarization rotation angle is described by φ=πlδn/λ, where lis the propagation length, δnthe difference in the effective indices between two orthogonal eigenmodes, and λthe operation wavelength. the rotator length for 90 ◦rotation lπ/2is given by λ/2δn. the measured output spectra for both polarization components of a 35- μm-long device are shown in fig. 1.31a. although the incident light has a tm-like compo- nent, the tm-like component after passing through the device is suppressed and the te-like component becomes dominant. in other words, the incident tm componentis converted into te. the excess loss through the device is about 1 db. the spectral ripples are caused by the polarization rotation in the normal silicon waveguides used for input and output, and they complicate the estimation of the actual rotation angle.a poincare-mapping measurement gives a more accurate rotation angle and also the extinction ratio. as shown in fig. 1.31b, the maximum rotation angle is 72 ◦, and the maximum extinction ratio is about 11 db, which is obtained for a 35- μm-long device [ 48]. fig. 1.31 (a) measured transmission spectra of the polarization rotator with a length of 35 μm; (b) polarization rotation angle estimated by the measured poincare map and polarization extinction ratio calculated from the measured rotation angle1 silicon photonic wire waveguides: fundamentals and applications 25 1.5.2 polarization diversity a microscope image of the fabricated polarization diversity circuit is shown in fig. 1.32 [46]. the circuit consists of polarization splitters, rotators, and a ring resonator wavelength ﬁlter with a 10- μm radius. the ring resonator has an extraordi- nary polarization dependence, which is shown in fig. 1.15. in this diversity circuit, a splitter for the input separates the te and tm components and feeds them into two waveguides. for the waveguide for the tm-like mode, the polarization is rotatedinto the te-like mode. thus, the polarization-dependent ring resonator can be used for both polarization inputs. there are two output waveguides for the ring resonator. in one of the waveguides, the te-like mode is rotated into the tm-like mode andﬁnally combined with another te-like mode. in such a geometry, there is no pd λ, because this system uses only one functional device working for the te mode. moreover, the symmetry of the circuit eliminates the pdl and pmd originatingfrom the normal waveguiding section [ 46] transmission spectra for wavelength ﬁlters with and without the polarization diversity are shown in fig. 1.33. without the diversity, the ring resonator works fig. 1.32 photograph of the polarization diversity circuit for a ring resonator ﬁlter fig. 1.33 measured transmission spectra of a ring resonator with and without polarization diversity26 k. yamada as a ﬁne wavelength ﬁlter for te polarization, but it does not work at all for tm polarization. on the other hand, with polarization diversity, the circuit shows almostthe same ﬁlter characteristics for both polarizations. the measured pdl of 1 db is suitable for practical use. 1.6 summary silicon photonic wire waveguides, featuring very strong optical conﬁnement andcompatibility with silicon electronics, provide us with a highly integrated platform for electronic–photonic convergence. the fundamental propagation performance ofthe waveguide has already become a practical standard. some passive devices with sophisticated designs and dynamic devices with electronic structures have also been developed by using such waveguides. moreover, the waveguide offers an efﬁcient media for nonlinear optical functions. the polarization dependence, which is a serious obstacle to telecommunications applications, can be eliminated by usinga monolithically integrated polarization diversity system. in the next development stage, efforts will mainly shift to a large scale photonic integration in which passive, dynamic, and active devices will be integrated on achip. the ultimate goal is, of course, a large-scale electronic–photonic integration, which is the most important advantage of the silicon photonic wire waveguide. references 1. g.-l. bona, r. germann, b.j. offrein, sion high-refractive-index waveguide and planar light- wave circuits. ibm j. res.

waveguide components using cladding stress engineering dan-xia xu abstract this chapter reviews the characteristics of soi ridge waveguide birefrin- gence, as governed by the waveguide cross-section geometry, the cladding stress level, and cladding thickness. typical stress levels in dielectric cladding ﬁlms such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride are such that the stress-induced birefringence is of comparable magnitude to the waveguide geometrical birefringence. thereforethe total waveguide birefringence can be precisely controlled by counter-balancing these two factors. the application of this technique for achieving polarization inde- pendence in a variety of photonic components is described, as well as an example ofpolarization splitting. passive and active tuning of the stress-induced birefringence is discussed. the use of birefringence tuning to enhance the efﬁciency in optical parametric processes and stress-induced pockels electro-optic effect are also brieﬂyaddressed. 2.1 introduction polarization is a property of electromagnetic waves that describes the orientation ofthe electric and magnetic ﬁeld oscillations. in free space, these oscillations are inthe plane perpendicular to the wave’s direction of propagation. a lightwave of arbi- trary polarization can be represented as the linear superposition of two orthogonally polarized modes, usually selected as the transverse electric (te, with the electric ﬁeld parallel to the wafer plane in a planar waveguide) and transverse magnetic (tm) modes. the fundamental polarization effects are polarization-dependent loss(pdl) and birefringence [ 1,2]. intrinsic pdl in silicon waveguides is mainly due to scattering from the waveguide core-cladding interfaces [ 3]. in a photonic compo- nent, a pdl may also arise from other loss sources, for example, the polarization-dependent bend loss [ 4]. in this chapter we focus on the effects of waveguide birefringence. d.-x. xu ( b) institute for

respect to polarization in the propagation constant (or the effective index) of the optical modes. in otherwords, light waves with different polarization states travel at different speeds when a waveguide is birefringent. waveguide birefringence may arise from intrinsic mate- rial properties such as in a garnet crystal, or due to geometrical anisotropies suchas in polarization maintaining ﬁbers and silicon ridge waveguides, or induced by external (mechanical) distortion such as often observed by bending a glass optical ﬁber. in structures with strong optical conﬁnement, such as silicon photonic wirewaveguides of sub-micron dimensions, the electric and magnetic oscillations are no longer perpendicular to the direction of travel, but have an appreciable component in that direction. the polarization dependence of waveguides presents one of the most difﬁcult challenges in the design of planar waveguide components. light sources used in modern communication systems are often semiconductor lasers, which emit linearly polarized light. this light is often regenerated using erbium doped ﬁber ampliﬁers, which can decrease the degree of polarization due to the ampliﬁed spontaneousemission (ase) background of the ampliﬁers [ 5]. fibers used in optical links are generally not polarization maintaining, either due to accidental loss of circular symmetry in the ﬁber poling process or due to mechanical distortions in the ﬁbercable. the polarization state ﬂuctuates randomly on a millisecond scale after trav- elling a distance of several kilometers [ 1,2]. in spectroscopy, the excitation source may come from natural light sources such as the sun light, which may be partiallypolarized or unpolarized [ 6]. even if the excitation comes from a laser with linear polarization, the state of polarization is often modiﬁed after transmission/reﬂection from the medium of interest. these phenomena are the root causes of impedi-ments in optical systems including polarization-dependent wavelength shift (pdw), polarization-dependent mode dispersion (pmd), and polarization-dependent loss. the preferred approach to handle this issue is to produce devices with polarizationinsensitive performance. when this approach is not practical, a polarization diversity scheme may be adopted where the signal is divided into orthogonal polarization states using a polarization splitter and processed separately. due to the increased complexity, the question of whether the polarization diversity method is commer- cially viable is still a subject of debate. silicon photonics has seen rapid progress as evidenced by this book sequel, and many building blocks have been developed for applications in optical telecommu- nication, interconnect, spectroscopy, and optical sensing. control and utilizationof polarization-dependent properties remains a challenge, but new solutions and functionalities also have been demonstrated [ 7–17]. the waveguides employed in commercial devices are mainly medium sized ridge waveguides for better fabri-cation tolerance and ﬁber-to-waveguide coupling. a considerable fraction of the silicon photonics research is concerned with sub-micron photonic wire waveguides to achieve a smaller device footprint and higher optical intensity, but accompanied2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 33 by stringent fabrication requirements. components using sub-micron waveguides demand a different strategy to deal with polarization controls and are beyond thescope of this work. in this chapter, we review the characteristics of polarization dependence, particularly birefringence, in silicon-on-insulator (soi) waveguides of 1–5μm ridge height, with regard to the two main sources of polarization anisotropy, namely the geometrical and the cladding stress-induced birefringence [ 11,12,18]. since the early theoretical analysis [ 19,20] and demonstration of using cladding stress-induced birefringence to produce a polarization-independent (pi) arrayedwaveguide grating (awg) [ 11,21], the importance of stress-induced birefringence has increasingly been recognized [ 18,22–26]. cladding stress engineering has been applied to different components, including pi ring resonators [ 13,14], pi mach- zehnder interferometers for differential phase shift keying (dpsk) [ 16,23], low loss pi triplexers for ﬁber-to-the-home (ftth) applications [ 15], phase matching in raman wavelength conversion [ 24,25], as well as broadband polarization splitters [26]. in this chapter we review the main characteristics of cladding stress-induced effects, design methodologies, and experimental demonstrations of their applica- tions. numerical analysis is focused on waveguides with 1.5–2.2 μm ridge heights, while scaling and the relative importance of stress-induced effects with core size are also discussed. the intent is to give a pictorial understanding of the pertinentcharacteristics in order to assist the readers to use this technique in their own applications. this chapter is organized as follows. section 2.2discusses the general consid- erations in soi waveguide design. sections 2.3and2.4describe the main charac- teristics of the geometrical and cladding stress-induced birefringence, respectively. applications of cladding stress engineering to achieve different photonic function-alities are reviewed in sect. 2.5, and ﬁnally some conclusions are drawn in sect. 2.6. 2.2 soi waveguides: general considerations in planar waveguide components, two types of cross-section geometries are most frequently encountered, namely slab and ridge waveguides, as illustrated in fig. 2.1a, b. respective examples are the combiner sections in an arrayed

ridge. channel waveguides (fig. 2.1c), with the side slab etched down to the buried oxide layer, are also used for special purposes [ 27], but these are less common. in the overall component design, it is often required that certain waveguide sec- tions are both single mode and polarization independent. in applications such asdense wavelength division multiplexing (dwdm) and high resolution spectroscopy, the birefringence must be below 10 −4for acceptable polarization insensitive perfor- mance [ 28]. an appropriate mode shape to assist the smooth transition between dif- ferent waveguide sections and a small bend radius to minimize device footprint are also essential. another important consideration is the fabrication tolerance, which is the ability to achieve and maintain the pre-designed values of the effective index andbirefringence using available fabrication technologies. all these properties depend on the waveguide cross-section geometry. 2.2.1 single-mode condition due to the high-index contrast in the soi material platform, waveguides with dimen-sions larger than a few hundred nanometers in cross-section usually support multiple modes. nevertheless, large ridge waveguides can be designed to exhibit single-mode-like behavior provided the waveguide width (w)and etch depth (d)fulﬁl certain conditions relative to the ridge height h(see fig. 2.1b). soref et al. ﬁrst proposed the following single-mode condition for soi waveguides [ 29]: w h≤0.3+r√ 1−r2,r=h h, (2.1a) 0.5≤r≤1, (2.1b) where h=h−dis the slab height in the lateral etched sections. the restriction of eq. 2.1b is imposed based on the argument that for r≥0.5, the effective index of the fundamental “vertical mode” in the etched slab regions becomes larger than the effective index of all vertical higher order modes in the ridge. therefore the higher order modes in the ridge become “leaky,” and eventually dissipate after asufﬁciently long propagation distance. in the original investigation, a propagation distance of 2 mm was used to verify the single-mode-like behavior in waveguides with a height of h=4μm, using the beam propagation method (bpm) [ 29]. since then, several groups have continued the study on this subject [ 30–34], with modiﬁed single-mode conditions extended to waveguides of smaller dimensions and deeper etch. for example, chan et al. established the following condition for waveguideswith ridge height of h=1–1.5μm for the tm polarization [ 34]: w h≤0.05+(0.94+0.25h)r√ 1−r2, (2.2a) 0.3<r<0.5 and 1 .0≤h≤1.5, (2.2b)2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 35 in this study, the single-mode boundary was established also by using the bpm algo- rithm, with a propagation length of 4 mm. lousteau et al. have observed that nearthe single-mode condition, certain so called “sticky modes” can exist with rather low radiation loss, and therefore persist after a considerable propagation distance [ 33]. 2.2.2 higher order mode filtering the single-mode conditions described in sect. 2.2.1 only apply to straight waveg- uides. it is well known that higher order modes suffer larger radiation losses at waveguide bends, and this mechanism can be used as an efﬁcient method to ﬁlter out unwanted higher order modes. both the fundamental and higher order modelosses, including the bend loss and scattering loss, are polarization sensitive. for the intrinsic bend loss (when the sidewall roughness is not considered), it has been shown that the tm modes can sustain a much smaller bend radius than the te mode [ 4,14]. scattering loss due to sidewall roughness, on the other hand, depends on the mode-sidewall overlap, which in turn depends on the speciﬁcs ofthe waveguide geometry and interface condition. it is therefore more difﬁcult to make a general statement, though this loss is certainly polarization dependent [ 3]. waveguide bends have been used in various cases to allow a deeper etch depththan predicted by eq. ( 2.1)o r( 2.2), with the ﬁnal devices exhibiting single-mode behavior and having a reduced device size [ 11,14,35,36]. in the sections to fol- low, we will discuss some waveguide designs that may not satisfy the single-modeconditions described previously, but have been validated through experiments to function satisfactorily. on the other hand, the effectiveness of higher order mode ﬁltering using waveguide bends depends not only on the bend radius used but alsothe propagation distance and device requirements for the suppression of higher order modes. in determining the waveguide cross-section to achieve single-mode like behavior, all these aspects need to be taken into account to ensure acceptable deviceperformance. 2.3 waveguide birefringence: geometrical effects for ridge waveguides with a height of 1–5 μm, the minor components in the optical modes are sufﬁciently small, and the modes can usually be well described as te and tm polarized modes. modal phase birefringence can then be deﬁned as the differ- ence in the effective indices of the tm and te polarizations, /delta1neff=ntm eff−nte eff, and it is a combined consequence of the geometrical and stress-induced anisotropy. the effective index can be expressed as nte,tm eff=nte,tm geo +δnte,tm stress for te and tm polarizations, and the total birefringence is /delta1neff=/delta1ngeo+/delta1nstress.h e r e nte,tm geo and/delta1ngeoare the effective indices and birefringence solely determined by the waveguide geometry in the absence of stress, and δnte,tm stress and/delta1nstress are the stress-induced effective index and birefringence changes, respectively. the36 d.-x. xu geometrical birefringence originates from the different boundary conditions for the perpendicular and transverse electric ﬁeld components of the optical modes at thewaveguide core and cladding interfaces. its magnitude depends on the strength of the ﬁeld components at these interfaces, which is controlled by the refractive index contrast and the core size. in low index contrast platforms such as glass waveguides,the geometrical effect is negligible and the birefringence is primarily due to the residual stress in the waveguide layers. a large body of research has been devoted to this subject, where the main goal is to reduce the stress anisotropy in the waveguidecore region, for example, by matching the thermal expansion coefﬁcients of the cladding and core layers or creating stress relief features [ 37–42]. in high-index contrast waveguides such as soi where the light is strongly con- ﬁned, the cross-section geometry has the largest inﬂuence on the waveguide effec- tive index. the cross-section of ridge waveguides is typically selected to fulﬁl the single-mode condition ﬁrst, as discussed in sect. 2.2. the resulting lack of axial symmetry generally causes a strong geometrical birefringence. being a centro- symmetric crystal, silicon is optically isotropic in its natural state. when sub- jected to mechanical distortion, however, there is a stress-induced anisotropy in its polarizability and the associated material birefringence. in this section, we analyze the inﬂuence of the geometrical factors on the waveguide birefringence, while thestress-induced effects will be discussed in sect. 2.4. 2.3.1 waveguide cross-section using a full-vectorial ﬁnite element differential equation solver [ 43], mode solutions are calculated with the following parameters for ridge structures shown in fig. 2.1b: a refractive index of silicon and silicon dioxide (sio 2), in the absence of stress, of nsi=3.476 and noxide=1.444, and a free-space wavelength of λ=1,550 nm. the upper cladding is also assumed to be oxide in order to include the contribution of the oxide refractive index, but the presence of stress is excluded at this point. figure 2.2a shows the dependence of the geometrical birefringence /delta1ngeoon the etch depth dfor waveguides with different widths, with vertical sidewalls (θ=90◦) and a ridge height of h=2.2μm. for a given waveguide width w, the polarization degeneracy (/delta1ngeo=0)may only be achieved at a speciﬁc value of d.a tt h e birefringence-free point for w=1.6μm,/delta1ngeochanges by ∼1.5×10−4for an etch depth change of /delta1d=± 10 nm. when w=2.5μm,/delta1ngeois much less sen- sitive to the ﬂuctuations in d(/delta1n//delta1d∼2×10−5for/delta1d=± 10 nm); however, the birefringence-free condition cannot be achieved. to reduce the birefringencebelow the level required for the state-of-the-art photonic devices (/delta1n eff<10−4) by solely controlling the ridge aspect ratio w/d, dimensional control of less than 10 nm is required for these waveguides [ 11,13,35], which is difﬁcult to attain in fabrication. there has been extensive work on waveguides with vertical sidewalls that shows both polarization degeneracy and single-mode conditions can be simultaneously2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 37 –0.00200.0020.004 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 etch depth ( μm)birefringence δngeow = 1.6 μm 2.0 μm 2.5 μm(a) 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 etch depth d ( μm)–0.00200.0020.004birefringence δngeoθ = 90 ° 87° 72° 54°(b) fig. 2.2 calculated modal geometrical birefringence /delta1ngeofor waveguides with h=2.2μm.

(b) trapezoidal waveguide with a top width of 1.5 μm, and a sidewall angle of 54◦ rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides. with the dimensions as indicated in the ﬁgure, these two waveguides have similar mode size and can support similar bend radii. on the other hand, the modal ﬁeld for the trapezoidal waveguide has a smaller overlap with the si/oxide boundaries as compared to that in the rectangular waveg-uide. this basic feature is the main reason for the different behaviors of the two types of waveguides presented above. using reactive ion etching to pattern the waveguides, near vertical sidewall angles (θ>75 ◦)are common, while precisely maintaining θ=90◦is difﬁcult. using anisotropic wet chemical etching, a sidewall angle of 54◦is expected for waveguides parallel to the <110>crystal planes on a wafer with (100) orientation. indeed, a sidewall angle of θ<85◦is preferred for less stringent fabrication requirements. in-depth discussion on the inﬂuence of geometrical parameters can be found in pre- vious publications [ 12,44]. 2.3.2 scaling of the geometrical birefringence with core size with decreasing ridge height, the dependence of /delta1ngeoon the structure parameters increases drastically. figure 2.5as h o w s /delta1ngeoas a function of the waveguide aspect ratio r=h/hfor waveguides with ridge height from 4 to 1 μm and w=0.8h. for a large core size such as the example of h=4μm, the birefringence is gen- erally low. within a considerable range of rvalues, /delta1ngeois at acceptable levels (<10−4). for small core sizes, however, only a narrow range of rvalues yields a low birefringence. figure 2.5b shows the change in /delta1ngeofor a ﬂuctuation in the etch depth of d=± 2.5%h, with data extracted from fig. 2.5a near the birefringence-free points. for h=1μm,/delta1ngeochanges with a slope of ∼2×10−3 for/delta1d=± 10 nm, which is prohibitively high for many applications. using contact-print lithography, waveguide width variations on the order of 100 nm can be expected. using state-of-the-art high resolution lithography methods such as e-beam direct write or deep-uv steppers, dimensional control on the order of 10 nm is possible but is still very challenging. because it is difﬁcult to preciselycontrol the waveguide dimensions due to limitations of the fabrication techniques, methods of controlling birefringence other than modifying waveguide geometries are desirable.2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 39 –0.03–0.02–0.0100.010.02 0.1 0.3 0.5 r = h/hbirefringence δngeo  h=1 h=2 h=3 h=4 1.e–051.e–041.e–031.e–02 0246 ridge height h ( μm)change in δngeo   (a) (b) fig. 2.5 (a) geometrical birefringence /delta1ngeoas a function of the waveguide aspect ratio r=h/h, for ridge height of h=1, 2, 3, and 4 μm, respectively. waveguide width w=0.8h .( b) change in /delta1ngeofor a change in the etch depth of d=± 2.5%h, as a function of h, near the birefringence- free points shown in ( a) 2.3.3 dispersion and group index birefringence the properties of most ﬁlters, resonators, and spectrometers are dependent on the waveguide effective index neffand the group index ng=neff−λ∂neff/∂λ.t h e effective index generally is a function of wavelength, which in part originates from the material dispersion and also is inﬂuenced by the waveguide cross-section. dueto the strong modal conﬁnement by the high-index contrast soi waveguide bound- aries, the effective index dispersion is a strong function of the waveguide geometry. since the conﬁnements of the te and tm modes are different, the phase birefrin-gence also has dispersion. the group index n gis thus both wavelength and polar- ization dependent. figure 2.6shows the geometrical (phase) effective index and the group index birefringence as a function of wavelength λfor waveguides of different widths and –0.005–0.004–0.002–0.0010.0010.003 1.46 1.51 1.56 1.61 wavelength ( μm)birefringence δneff  –0.010–0.0050.0000.0050.010 1.46 1.51 1.56 1.61 wavelength ( μm)birefringence δng w = 0.8  μm  1.0  μm  1.5  μm  2.0  μm  w = 0.8  μm 1.0  μm 1.5  μm 2.0  μm  (a) (b) fig. 2.6 wavelength dependence of the waveguide geometrical birefringence (in the absence of cladding stress) for different waveguide widths. the ridge has a height of h=1.5μma n dt h e etch depth is d=0.9μm.

[ 7]. 2.4 cladding stress-induced birefringence: theory and modeling the subject of photoelasticity deals with the birefringence developed in a solid under the application of mechanical stress. discovered in 1815 by sir david brewster in jellies from the observation of artiﬁcial double refraction, this effect was sub- sequently analyzed in crystals by pockels, who also discovered the electro-opticeffect, now bearing his name [ 45]. the pockels effect describes the generation of birefringence on the application of an electric ﬁeld, and this is discussed further in sect. 2.5.6 . today, photoelasticity is widely used in many areas of engineering, notably in identifying structural deformations. stress in planar waveguides can come from several sources. the most common is the mismatch in the thermal expansion coefﬁcients between the waveguide core,cladding and substrate materials, or other thin ﬁlms deposited on top of the waveg- uides such as metal electrical contacts. cladding layers such as silicon dioxide are usually deposited or grown at elevated temperatures on the silicon substrateto provide passivation for the silicon surface and optical isolation from the external environment. a (compressive) stress is generally present in the sio 2ﬁlms on si substrates, since the latter has a much larger thermal expansion coefﬁcient than that of the oxide ( αsi=3.6×10−6k−1andαoxide=5.4×10−7k−1). intrinsic stress can also be signiﬁcant in some thin ﬁlms, particularly in metals. in this section weconsider the effects of stress on a silicon waveguide, using a sio 2cladding as the primary example. active tuning of the stress using a piezoelectric ﬁlm cladding will be discussed in sect. 2.5.5 . 2.4.1 photoelastic effect when a material is subjected to mechanical distortions, the resulting strain/stress modiﬁes the crystal electronic structure on a microscopic scale by changing the bondlengths between the atoms. the crystal symmetry and therefore the polarizability of the material are altered. the change in the refractive index ellipsoid n ijcan be related to the strain εijin terms of the photoelastic tensor pijas [19,46]:2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 41 /delta1(1 n2) i=pijεj, (2.3) where the contracted tensor notation is used (i.e., 1 →xx, 2→yy, 3→zz, 4→ zy, 5→zx, 6→xy). in cubic crystal (hence optically isotropic) materials such as silicon, eq. ( 2.3) can be simpliﬁed and expressed as the strain-induced change in the refractive index for light polarized along the i-axis ( i=1, 2, 3): ni−n0=−1 2n3 0pijεj. (2.4) since the waveguide is usually very long in the propagation direction z(see fig. 2.1), the shear strain in this direction can be ignored and the refractive index is considered unaltered. using the stress-strain relation in an isotropic medium, the expressionbetween the refractive index and stress σ iis found to be [ 19,46] nx−n0=− c1σx−c2(σy+σz), (2.5a) ny−n0=− c1σy−c2(σz+σx). (2.5b) hereσi(i=x,y,z)are the principal stress tensor components along the x-,y-, andz-directions, respectively (see fig. 2.1),niis the material refractive index in the corresponding direction, and n0is the (isotropic) refractive index in the absence of stress. since stress levels in uniform thin ﬁlms can be readily measured experimen-tally, the following discussions use the stress-related expressions. the stress-optic constants c 1andc2are related to the young’s modulus ( e), poisson’s ratio ( ν), and the photoelastic tensor elements ( p11and p12)as c1=n3 0 2e(p11−2vp12), (2.6a) c2=n3 0 2e(−vp11+(1−v)p12).

(2.9c) although the plane strain model has been widely used to calculate stress in waveguides [ 52–54], it introduces a strong artiﬁcial tensile stress σzin the silicon waveguide core and the substrate, but lower compressive stress in the cladding lay- ers along the zaxis. these changes in stress cause a uniform shift in the calculated material refractive indices nxand ny, which in turn changes the effective indices of the waveguide modes by approximately 10%, and therefore the stress-induced birefringence by a similar amount. this can be important in modelling interference based polarization controlled devices employing stress [ 12]. we have developed an alternative “normalized plane strain” model to circumvent this limitation [ 12]. rather than assuming no distortion along the z-axis, we assume that the top layers conform to the substrate during cooling. the strain component inthez-direction then takes the form of ε z=αs/delta1t, where αsis the thermal expansion44 d.-x. xu coefﬁcient of the silicon substrate. applying this relation to eq. ( 2.8), the stress- strain relation can be expressed in a form similar to the 2d equations in eq. ( 2.9): σ′ x=e (1+ν)(1−2ν)[ (1−ν)ε x+νεy] −( α−ν 1+ναs)αe/delta1t 1−2ν,(2.10a) σ′ y=e (1+ν)(1−2ν)[ νεx+(1−ν)ε y] −( α−ν 1+ναs)αe/delta1t 1−2ν,(2.10b) σ′ z=ν(σ′ x+σ′ y)−( α−ν 1+ναs) e/delta1t+1 1+ναse/delta1t, (2.10c) if “normalized” thermal expansion coefﬁcients are adopted: α′=α−ν 1+ναs. (2.11) the ﬁnal expression for σz′is obtained by adding a constant correction term: σ′ z=σz+1 1+ναse/delta1t, (2.12) where the stress ﬁeld σzis calculated as in eq. ( 2.9), with the modiﬁcation for the thermal expansion coefﬁcients as in eq. ( 2.11). this means that the ordinary plane- strain algorithm, commonly available in commercial multi-physics software such as comsol physics, can be used as before to evaluate the x- and y-components of the stress distribution in the waveguides, using the normalized thermal expansion coefﬁcients. using this 2d “normalized plane-strain model”, accuracies comparable to full 3d simulations can be achieved, but with much reduced computation timeand memory requirement. further details on this simulation method can be found in [12]. we deﬁne a parameter σ ﬁlmas the in-plane stress component (in the xdirection, σx)that is present in the uniform upper cladding ﬁlm, far away from the ridge. allowing unconstrained thermal expansion in all directions, it can be expressed as σﬁlm=σx=(αs−αoxide)e 1−ν/delta1t, (2.13) where αsandαoxide are the thermal expansion coefﬁcients of the si substrate and sio 2cladding ﬁlm, respectively. the value of σﬁlmis also readily available from the simulation output. experimentally, the value of the stress in a cladding ﬁlmcan be measured from the change in bowing radius of a blanket wafer before and after deposition of the stressed ﬁlm [ 55,56]. we use σ ﬁlmto characterize the stress in the cladding ﬁlm to emulate the experimental conditions. using the mechanicalproperties listed in table 2.1, the temperature difference /delta1tbetween the thermal equilibrium (deposition) and operating temperatures is used as a ﬁtting parameter to match the experimentally measured σ ﬁlm. for example, /delta1t=400◦c yields2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 45 σﬁlm=− 105 mpa, whereas /delta1t=1,120◦c yields σﬁlm=− 300 mpa. the small stress gradient in the ﬁlm thickness direction ( y-direction) is neglected. as we have discussed at the beginning of this section, generally /delta1t≤400◦c for pecvd depositions and the measured ﬁlm stress is in the range of −100 to −400 mpa. the discrepancy between experimental stress levels and the calculated values forpecvd deposition temperatures indicate that thermal stress alone does not account for the stress levels commonly observed in the oxide ﬁlms, and intrinsic stress likely is present. 2.4.3 cladding stress-induced birefringence in waveguides the stress distribution in a waveguide depends on the core and cladding materialconstants, and the waveguide cross-section geometry, including the cladding ﬁlmthickness and its coverage on the ridge sidewalls. using the relations described in eqs. ( 2.10–2.12 ), the stress components σ xandσy, and the corresponding modiﬁed material refractive indices nxandnycan be computed. a full-vectorial mode solver is then used to calculate the modiﬁed effective index. the stress distributions and the material birefringence ( ny−nx)in soi ridge waveguides are discussed below for an sio 2lower cladding of thickness 0.37 μm, an sio 2upper cladding of thickness 1 μm and a step coverage of 70%, under a compressive stress of σﬁlm=− 300 mpa. the ridges have a height of h=1.5μm and an etch depth of d=0.9μm. two examples are shown, with fig. 2.7for a vertical sidewall waveguide with w=1.5μm and θ=90◦, and fig. 2.8for a trapezoidal waveguide with w=1μm and θ=54◦. these two waveguides have similar widths at the optical mode center and provide similar light conﬁnement. in both cases, the primarily in-plane stress in the oxide ﬁlm compresses the si ridge, resulting in a compressive stress in the x-direction (figs. 2.7a and 2.8a) and a higher tensile stress in the y-direction (figs. 2.7b and 2.8b) in the silicon core. at the mode centre, σx∼− 53 mpa and σy∼1 3 0m p ai nf i g . 2.7, while σx∼− 60 mpa andσy∼97 mpa in fig. 2.8. this stress anisotropy is the fundamental cause of the stress-induced birefringence. the corresponding local material birefringence (ny−nx)is shown in figs. 2.7c and 2.8c, with a value of ∼5×10−3at the mode centre for the vertical sidewall waveguide. these modiﬁcations in the material index cause the modal effective index ntm effto increase and nte effto decrease, for a cladding ﬁlm with a compressive stress. in other words, the stress-induced changes in the effective index δntm stress<0 andδnte stress<0 forσﬁlm<0. figure 2.9illustrates the dependence of the effective indices on the cladding thickness for the vertical waveguide with a material birefringence distribu- tion shown in fig. 2.7. these effective index changes in the opposite direction for te and tm are due to the opposite signs of the stress-optic constants c1and c2 for silicon (see table 2.1). this fact makes stress engineering a particularly efﬁcient method for changing the silicon waveguide birefringence, as compared to that for other materials where c1andc2are of the same sign.46 d.-x. xu (c) ny −nx sio2 si sio2 si sio2 si sio2 si(a) xy 0.01 00.0060.008 0.004 0.002 −0.006−0.002 −0.004 −−−0200mpa −600−400−200 (b) sio2 si sio2 si (c) ny −nx sio2 si sio2 siσx σy fig. 2.7 stress distributions in the ( a)x-direction and ( b)y-direction; and ( c) stress-induced mate- rial birefringence ( ny−nx), for a waveguide with h=1.5μm,w=1.5μm,d=0.9μm, and θ=90◦. the cladding oxide is 1 μm thick with a compressive stress of σﬁlm=− 300 mpa sio2 si sio2 sixyσx (a) −600−400−2000200mpa sio2 sio2σy si si(b) sio2 sio2si si(c) ny − nx0.01 00.0060.008 0.004 0.002 −0.002 −0.004 −0.006 fig. 2.8 stress distributions in the ( a)x-direction and ( b)y-direction; ( c) stress-induced material birefringence ( ny−nx), for a waveguide with h=1.5μm,w=1μm,d=0.9μm, and θ=54◦. the cladding parameters are the same as in fig. 2.7 fig. 2.9 (a) effective indices for the te and tm polarizations as a function of the oxide upper claddingthickness t c, for different cladding stress levels ofσ ﬁlm=0,−100, and −200 mpa, respectively. the waveguide dimensions are h=1.5μm,w= 1.5μm,d=0.9,μma n d θ=90◦0 0.5 1 1.5effective indexte tm 3.4093.4103.4113.4123.413 cladding thickness tc (um)σfilm= 0 mpa −100 −200 −100 0−200te tm the upper cladding thickness tcis another important parameter governing the stress-induced changes δnte stress,δntm stress, and thus /delta1nstress( =δntm stress−δntm stress) , since the force exerted on the silicon core in the x-direction scales with both σﬁlm and ﬁlm thickness. with increasing upper cladding thickness,⏐⏐δntm stress⏐⏐and⏐⏐δntm stress⏐⏐ increase at ﬁrst and eventually reach a plateau for large tc, when the silicon ridge is entirely buried under the oxide and the force saturates. it is evident that the impactof stress increases with the etch depth dand the sidewall angle θ, but decreases with the waveguide width w. as can be observed in figs. 2.7and2.8,σ x<0 and σy>0 in the regions where the optical mode has signiﬁcant intensity. on examining2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 47 eq. ( 2.5), one can conclude that |δntm|>|δntm|for most waveguide geometries, as also shown in fig. 2.9. the corresponding total modal birefringence /delta1neff, including the geometrical and stress-induced contributions, is illustrated as a function of the upper oxide thick- ness for the waveguides with vertical and slanted sidewalls in figs. 2.10a and b, respectively. a cladding with a compressive stress induces a positive shift in /delta1neff that increases with the amplitude of σﬁlm, whereas a cladding material with a tensile stress (for example, some silicon nitride ﬁlms) would induce a negative shift in/delta1n eff. for the waveguide dimensions presented here, the optical ﬁeld is sufﬁciently conﬁned within a 0.3 μm thickness of the oxide cladding owing to the high-index contrast. a thickness range of 0.3–1.5 μm is available for birefringence tuning, giving a tuning range of /delta1nstress∼5×10−3forσﬁlm=− 300 mpa. for thick- nesses larger than 1.5 μm, little additional stress-induced changes can be obtained for these waveguides. as expected from the material birefringence distributionshown earlier, the stress-induced birefringence is slightly smaller in the trapezoidal waveguide. the total birefringence /delta1n effcan therefore be controlled with two parameters: the oxide cladding thickness tcand the ﬁlm stress level σﬁlm. the stress-induced refractive index variations resulting from commonly used oxide cladding ﬁlms areof comparable magnitude to the geometrical birefringence found in typical soi ridge waveguides. depending on the speciﬁc value of the geometrical birefringence /delta1n geo,/delta1nstress can be used to adjust the total modal birefringence to be zero or some other desired values to fulﬁl the particular required functions. for example, as will be discussed in sect. 2.5.2 , the condition of /delta1neff=0 is not always mandatory for achieving polarization-independent performance of a device. for componentssuch as ring resonators and mach-zehnder interferometers (mzi) which have a cyclic spectral response, shifting the te and tm spectra by one or even several free spectral ranges (fsrs) can also give apparent polarization independence. –0.005–0.003–0.0010.0010.0030.005 0 0.5 1 1.5 cladding thickness tc (um)birefringence δneffσfilm= −400 mpa −300 −200 0−100(a) –0.005–0.003–0.0010.0010.003 0 0.5 1 1.5−300 −200 0−100 cladding thickness tc (um)birefringence δneff σfilm= −400 mpa(b) fig. 2.10 total modal birefringence /delta1neffas a function of the oxide upper cladding thickness tc, for different cladding stress levels σﬁlmof 0,−100,−200,−300, and −400 mpa, respectively.

( 2.5), it can be shown that the stress-induced changes in the mode parameters nte eff,ntm effand/delta1neffare also linear functions of the stress components. for a given waveguide core geometry, we can ﬁrst obtain the valuesofδnte,tm 0for a particular stress level σ0, over a speciﬁc range of the cladding thickness tc. once the curves at σ0are determined, the values for other cladding stress levels σﬁlmcan be readily calculated. it is veriﬁed through simulations that the following relations apply: δntm stress=σﬁlm σ0δntm 0, (2.14a) δnte stress=σﬁlm σ0δnte 0, (2.14b) /delta1nstress=σﬁlm σ0(δntm 0−δnte 0). (2.14c) the results presented in fig. 2.10 illustrate these relations. for example, the curves forσﬁlm=− 100 mpa can be used as baselines δnte,tm 0for each waveguide, deter- mined by the waveguide core geometry and cladding thickness, and the values at other stress levels scale linearly by a factor σﬁlm/σ0. figure 2.11 shows the calculated results for the maximum /delta1nstress that can be induced with σﬁlm=− 300 mpa (with cladding thickness tc=2μm) in waveguides with h=2μm and different aspect ratios r[57]. this illustrates the range, sign and general characteristics of the stress-induced birefringence /delta1nstress available in soi waveguides that can be advantageously employed for different applications. 3.53.02.52.01.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.01.0 0.80.9 0.7 0.60.50.4–0.00030.00050.00130.00210.00290.0037 r = 1 −d/hw/h fig. 2.11 stress-induced modal birefringence /delta1nstress for ridge waveguides with different aspect ratios, with h=2μm,tc=2μma n d σﬁlm=− 300 mpa2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 49 2.4.4 stress-induced mode mismatch to fulﬁl some photonic functions, as in the example of a polarization splitter to be discussed in sect. 2.5.3 , it is required that the upper cladding layer only be applied to a selected section of the components. the mode mismatch at the junction betweenthe bare silicon and oxide clad core, as shown in fig. 2.12a, is a potential source of propagation loss. from previous discussions, we observe that the stress-induced changes are⏐⏐⏐δnte,tm stress⏐⏐⏐≤5×10−3, for oxide stress levels that are commonly available (|σﬁlm|<400 mpa ). these changes are orders of magnitude smaller than the cladding-core index contrast of ∼2 in soi waveguides. the stress-induced modiﬁ- cation to the mode proﬁle is thus negligible, leading to minimal mode mismatch loss. figure 2.12b shows the corresponding mode mismatch loss, calculated as the optical mode overlap integral between the two sections, for waveguides of widths w=1.5 and 2.5μm, a ridge height of h=2.2μm and an etch depth of d=1.5μm. the loss is slightly larger for the narrower waveguide, but still practically negligible (less than 0.001 db). the loss for tm is slightly higher than that for te, due to the fact that|δntm stress|>|δnte stress|as shown in fig. 2.9. for waveguides with even smaller core dimensions, this loss increases, but is expected to be within acceptable levels for values of hdown to 1 μm. –0.0008–0.0006–0.0004–0.00020.00000.0002 0 100 200 300 400 compressive cladding stress (mpa)mismatch loss (db)w = 2.5 μm w = 1.5 μmte tm sio2 si substratesi sio2 (a)(b)te/tm fig. 2.12 (a) schematic of a junction between the bare silicon and oxide clad waveguide core; ( b) stress-induced mode mismatch loss at the junction as a function of the cladding stress level, for teand tm polarizations. the waveguide dimensions are h=2.2μm,d=1.5μm,w=1.5a n d 2.5μm, with a cladding of 1 μm thick. for w=1.5μm, the curves for te and tm nearly overlap 2.4.5 stress-induced effect on the group index birefringence as we have discussed in sect. 2.3.3 , due to the high conﬁnement in soi waveg- uides, there is a signiﬁcant geometrical contribution to the waveguide dispersion inboth the effective index and birefringence. it was noted from fig. 2.6that for some waveguide geometries (e.g., w=1.5μm), the effective index geometrical birefrin- gence /delta1n geoand the group index birefringence /delta1nghave opposite signs, and that50 d.-x. xu –0.004–0.0020.0000.0020.0040.0060.0080.0100.012 1.46 1.51 1.56 1.61 wavelength ( μm)birefringence δneff w = 1 μm w = 1.5  μm(a) –0.008–0.0040.0000.0040.0080.012 1.46 1.51 1.56 1.61 wavelength ( μm)birefringence δng w = 1.5  μm w = 1 μm (b) fig. 2.13 the effect of cladding stress on the effective index and group index birefringence, as a function of wavelength. here h=1.5μm,w=1a n d1 .5μm,d=0.9μm,tc=0.8μm andσﬁlm=− 250 mpa. solid lines : in the absence of stress; dashed lines : including stress effects.

( 2.14). the stress-induced contribution to the total modal bire- fringence is signiﬁcant for a wide range of core sizes, even for cladding ﬁlms with arelatively low stress. these effects have to be taken into consideration in the design of soi waveguide components, and can be advantageously used for precise control of birefringence, as will be discussed next. fig. 2.15 stress-induced birefringence /delta1nstress as a function of the claddingthickness t c,i ns o i waveguides with w=0.9h and an aspect ratio r=0.375, for ridge heights h=1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 μm, respectively, as indicated inthe ﬁgure. the cladding stressσ ﬁlm=− 105 mpa0.00000.00050.00100.00150.0020 0123 cladding thickness ( μm)stress-induced birefringenceh=1 h=2 h=3 h=4 h=51 μm  2 3 4 552 d.-x. xu 2.5 cladding stress engineering: applications in the mid-1990s, several studies were reported that utilized the photoelastic effect to make strip-loaded waveguides in silicon [ 58,59]. using a strip or a gap of ∼6μm width in a wni metal ﬁlm on top of a si substrate, it was shown that the correspond-ing strip-loaded waveguide only guided the te or tm mode, respectively. therefore each type of waveguide can be used as a polarizer and an extinction ratio of 14 db was achieved [ 59]. in a later work, periodic oxide cladding sections were used to make polarization rotators [ 60]. in these cases, stress was the only mechanism for producing the desired functionalities. in the early 2000s, we proposed and demon- strated that cladding stress introduces a birefringence in silicon ridge waveguidesthat is of comparable magnitude to its geometrical birefringence [ 61,62] and that it can serve as an effective means to counter the effect of geometrical birefringence, yielding birefringence-free waveguides [ 11]. in this section, we present several examples of using cladding stress engineering to control polarization-dependent properties in both passive and active soi waveg- uide devices. in sect. 2.5.1 we present polarization-independent (pi) awg demul- tiplexers that we have developed, where the birefringence in the waveguide array is eliminated by the judicious selection of the oxide cladding stress and thickness[11,35]. examples of pi ring resonators [ 13,14], mzi differential phase shift key- ing (dpsk) demodulators [ 16] and a low loss pi triplexer [ 15] are introduced in sect. 2.5.2 . beneﬁting from the cyclic response of these devices, oxide (compres- sive) or nitride (tensile stress) claddings were used to modify the birefringence so that the te and tm spectra were shifted by integer multiples of the free-spectral- range (fsr). as the last example of stress-engineered passive devices, we discussin sect. 2.5.3 a polarization splitter in a zero-order awg conﬁguration, where a prism-shaped oxide patch is placed in the arrayed waveguide section to separate the te and tm modes into different output waveguides. since this awg operates atnear zero-order, broadband performance is achieved [ 26]. in sect. 2.5.4 , methods of birefringence trimming in passive waveguide components are presented. cladding stress engineering has also been used in active photonic components. active bire-fringence tuning and its use for phase matching in raman ampliﬁcation is described in sect. 2.5.5 . finally, the use of stress to alter the centro-symmetric crystal struc- ture of silicon, thereby introducing a pockels electro-optic effect, is discussed in sect. 2.5.6 . 2.5.1 polarization-independent awgs arrayed waveguide gratings are arguably the most commonly used wavelength dis- persive ﬁlters [ 28]. in awgs the polarization-dependent wavelength shift (pdw) /delta1λ=λtm−λtemainly arises from the birefringence of the arrayed waveg- uides and it can be expressed as /delta1λ=λ/delta1neff/ng, where /delta1neffand ngare the birefringence and group index of the array waveguides. in glass waveguide-based2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 53 awgs, a frequently used approach for obtaining pi performance is to minimize the residual stress to make the arrayed waveguides birefringence-free. another commonmethod is to insert a half-wave plate in the middle of the phased array to convert te polarization to tm and vice versa [ 63]. the insertion loss penalty, reﬂections at the interfaces, and higher order mode excitation make this method impractical forhigh-index contrast platforms like soi. introducing a triangular-shaped region in the combiner or the array section, which has a modiﬁed birefringence and acts as a prism, can be used to compensate the pdw as originally proposed and demonstratedby he et al. on inp awgs [ 64]. cheben et al. have shown that this method is effec- tive in eliminating pdw in awg devices made of soi ridge waveguides; however, it is also limited by the associated loss penalty [ 65]. we have subsequently shown that the use of a uniform cladding oxide with the appropriate stress and thickness to produce birefringence-free waveguide arrays is effective and simple to implement, as discussed below. the awgs used for the demonstration of polarization compensation using stress engineering were made on soi substrates with a silicon thickness of 2.2 μm, with nine output channels spaced at 200 ghz and centred at 1,550 nm [ 11,66] (see fig. 2.16a). the arrayed waveguide gratings of order 40 were formed by 100 waveguides of nominal width of 2 μm. waveguides were produced using either wet –40–35–30–25–20–15–10intensity (dbm ) –40–35–30–25–20–15–10 1528 1532 1536 1540 1544 wavelength (nm)intensity (dbm) –10123 0 0.5 1 1.5theoryexperiment (b)(c) (d) (a) 1 mm intensity (dbm)δλ= λtm−λte (nm) cladding thickness ( μm) fig. 2.16 (a) optical image of a fabricated awg.

(2.16) here lmmi is the length of the mmi section, and l1is the total length of the ring waveguide sections, l1=l−lmmi=2πr+lmmi. figure 2.18a shows the ring resonator phase difference, /delta1φ=φtm−φte, as a function of the oxide cladding thickness for two cladding stress levels. since a ring resonator has a cyclic trans-mission spectrum, apparent polarization independence in the resonance wavelength is achieved for /delta1φ=2πj(j=0,±1,±2...). as indicated in the ﬁgure, various combinations of cladding stress and thickness can be found for /delta1φto satisfy such conditions. figure 2.17b, c show the sem images of a fabricated mmi-coupled ring res- onator prior to oxide cladding deposition, and fig. 2.17d shows the waveguide cross-section with the oxide cladding. measured transmission spectra for te and tm polarizations for a ring resonator, having r=200μma n da0 . 8 - μm oxide cladding having σ ﬁlm=− 250 mpa, are shown in fig. 2.18b. over the 4-nm scan range, the polarization-dependent wavelength shift is measured to be below 2 pm, which is the laser scan step used in these measurements. the measured free spectralrange (fsr) is ∼0.46 nm, and the quality factor of q∼15,000 [ 14,75]. similar to ring resonators, a mzi is another example of devices that have a peri- odic spectral response. an mmi-coupled mach-zehnder delay interferometer (di)realized in 4- μm soi waveguide technology has been used for 40-gb/s differen- tial phase shift keying (dpsk) demodulation [ 16], with the device layout shown in fig. 2.19a. in these soi waveguides the polarizationdependent wavelength (or frequency) shift comes approximately in equal fraction from the geometrical and −20−15−10−50 1530.3 1530.8 1531.3 1531.8 1532.3 wavelength (nm)transmission (db) te tm−1.5−1.0−0.50.00.51.01.5 0.7 0.5 0.9 1.1 1.3 cladding thickness ( μm)phase difference ( π) –200 mpa–250 mpa (a) (b) fig. 2.18 (a) phase difference /delta1φ=φtm−φteas a function of the oxide cladding thickness for a mmi-coupled ring resonator with a radius rof 200 μm and an oxide cladding stress of −200 and−250 mpa, respectively; ( b) measured te and tm transmission spectra of the polarization- compensated ring resonator, with an upper sio 2cladding of 0.8 μm in thickness and a ﬁlm stress ofσﬁlm=− 250 mpa2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 57 (a)(b) (c) (d) (a)(b) (c) (d) fig. 2.19 (a) layout of the mach-zehnder delay interferometers, showing ﬁve dis and test struc- tures. the insert shows a 2 ×2 mmi coupler as a part of one di.

[ 16]) stress-induced birefringence, and very precise birefringence control (∼10−5), which is a key requirement for dpsk receivers, can be achieved by adjusting the stress- induced birefringence. a silicon nitride ﬁlm was used as the cladding layer, so that the tensile stress in the cladding shifts the te response by one fsr relativeto that of tm, therefore achieving apparent polarization independence. the mea- sured performance is shown in figs. 2.19b–d. these devices also showed a very low temperature dependence (polarization-dependent frequency shift pdf <1 ghz) for chip temperatures up to 70 ◦c. although the governing mechanisms are not yet fully understood, these results may originate from a combination of material thermo-optic effect and cladding stress-induced changes, similar to that suggested in the work on a porous silicon ﬁlter [ 76]. a triplexer for routing voice, data and video signals is an important component for ﬁber-to-the-home (ftth) networks. feng et al. have demonstrated a low loss triplexer design, shown in figs. 2.20a, b, consisting of two-stage cascaded trans- mitter/receiver ﬁlters using fourier-transform-based mzis [ 15]. the device is made insensitive to fabrication variations by employing appropriate directional couplers and optical delay lines. the key design parameters are the coupling properties of the directional couplers and the optical path length difference of the phase shiftsections /delta1l s, and both are functions of the waveguide effective index. the triplexer was fabricated in 3- μm-thick soi. two layers of thin ﬁlms are applied on top of the device to compensate the polarization-dependent phase difference. the couplersplitting ratio before and after the ﬁlm deposition is shown in figs. 2.20c, d. the coupling length difference between te and tm was reduced from 25 to 2%, and the polarization-dependent loss (pdl) was reduced to less than 0.1 db.58 d.-x. xu (a) (b)(d)(c) fig. 2.20 (a) layout of the ftth triplexer ﬁlter (not to scale) and ( b) detail of the directional cou- pler; splitting ratio of the coupler ( c) before and ( d) after stress-induced polarization compensation for both te and tm polarizations (after feng et al.

[ 26]) as we have discussed in sect. 2.4.4 , the stress-induced index modiﬁcations are several orders of magnitude smaller than the core-cladding refractive index contrast in soi, so that the effect of a sio 2cladding on the mode shape is negligible. thus there is negligible mode mismatch loss or polarization-dependent loss at the junc-tions between waveguide sections with and without the claddings. polarization splitters fabricated on soi wafers having a 2.2- μm-thick silicon layer are shown in fig. 2.22a, with an overall device size of ∼12 mm ×4 mm. the (a)1.5 mm −50−45−40−35−30−25−20 1537 1542 1547 1552 1557measured optical power (db)output ii: te output i: tm output ii: tmoutput i: te (b)oxide patch 30 μm measured optical power (db)1.5 mm measured optical power (db) 30 μm30 μm wavelength (nm)measured optical power (db) fig. 2.22 (a) a top view of the fabricated wavelength-independent zero-order awg polarization splitters (several devices shown). insert: sem image of the oxide cladding triangular patch in the waveguide array; ( b) measured transmission as a function of wavelength of a zero-order awg polarization splitter (after ye et al. [ 26])60 d.-x. xu deposited oxide cladding ﬁlm had a thickness of 1 μm, and the measured cladding ﬁlm stress was approximately −340 mpa. since stress-induced effects do not appre- ciably vary with wavelength (see sect. 2.4.5 ) and the awg operates near order zero, the performance of the splitter is expected to be wavelength independent over a large bandwidth, which was experimentally conﬁrmed. the measured extinctionratio of the polarization splitter was better than −10 db for both output polariza- tions over the full tuning range of the laser used (1,465–1,580 nm). figure 2.22b shows the measured polarization splitter transmission for a wavelength range of1,537–1,557 nm. over this range, the splitter extinction ratio is <−15 db, and the highest measured extinction ratio is −20 db. a similar birefringence modiﬁcation method was also applied in a mach-zehnder interferometer conﬁguration to formpolarization splitters and ﬁlters [ 82]. 2.5.4 trimming of birefringence in passive components even with advanced processing tools available today, variations in critical dimen- sions of devices fabricated with either an electron beam or deep-uv optical lithography are still inevitable. these variations may arise from silicon thickness non-uniformity from wafer to wafer, or from deviations on the wafer caused bylithography imperfection or etch non-uniformity. from discussions in sect. 2.3.2 , we noted that the effective index and birefringence are sensitive to dimensional variations, particularly as the core size is reduced. these changes lead to devicecentral wavelength shifts and polarization dependence. trimming of the waveg- uide effective index is still necessary in certain situations. active thermal tuning has been used for this purpose, but this approach adds to design complexity andpower consumption. another approach is trimming of the devices after fabrication, by adjusting the cladding stress level or thickness, which may be performed on a wafer level or on a device-by-device basis. stress in thin ﬁlms can be modiﬁed by thermal treatments. the extent of the modiﬁcation depends on the ﬁlm microscopic properties, thermal annealing tem- peratures, and durations. figure 2.23a shows such an example where the stress magnitude in a pecvd deposited oxide ﬁlm decreases with annealing temperature and duration [ 61]. anneals at 600 ◦c for 2 and 17 min were performed on an awg, and the corresponding polarization wavelength shifts are shown in fig. 2.23b, in reasonable agreement with simulations. stress in oxide or nitride thin ﬁlms can also be modiﬁed by electron beam and uv irradiation, which causes a volume compaction as well as a change in the refractive index, as has been shown by schrauwen et al. [ 84]. although both effects have an impact on the waveguide effective index, it was shown that the stress change is thedominant factor. electron beam irradiation was used to shift the resonance wave- length of a soi wire waveguide (220 ×500 nm 2)ring resonator with a 2- μm-thick oxide cladding, and a red shift of ∼4.9 nm was demonstrated. figure 2.24 shows the evolution of the resonator transmission spectrum during one stage of the trimming2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 61 −0.50.00.51.01.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1initial rta (2min) rta (17min)δλ = λtm  −λte (nm) cladding thickness ( μm)−335 mpa −265 mpa −227 mpa (b) −380−360−340−320−300−280−260−240−220 −50 51 0 1 5 2 0600 c 500 c time (min)stress σfilm (mpa) (a) fig. 2.23 (a) changes in the stress level as a function of anneal time for a blanket pecvd oxide ﬁlm; ( b) calculated ( line) and measured ( symbols ) polarization-dependent wavelength shift for the corresponding anneals (after xu et al.

( b) evolution of the resonance during the scanning by a 0.84-na electron beam (after schrauwen et al. [ 84]) process, when the ring resonator on the right side was scanned by a 0.84-na electron beam. although the contribution of the different microscopic mechanisms and the long term stability of this method still require further investigation, this method can potentially be used for trimming individual devices in an integrated photoniccircuit.62 d.-x. xu the oxide cladding thickness may be reduced globally with chemical or reactive ion etching. the thickness of a stress-inducing amorphous silicon ﬁlm was reducedlocally using laser trimming for adjusting the birefringence in glass waveguide ring resonator and mzi devices [ 85]. direct ablation of oxide ﬁlms is more difﬁcult, since oxide is transparent to most available laser sources. the use of additionalstress inducing ﬁlms on oxide clad soi components is also possible. even though allowing local trimming, this approach certainly adds process complexity. 2.5.5 phase matching in raman and other nonlinear processes and active birefringence tuning silicon as a nonlinear medium has received a surge of interest in recent years [25,86]. raman scattering was proposed and demonstrated as a mechanism for producing optical ampliﬁers, lasers, and wavelength converters. one motivation forthis approach is the fact that the stimulated raman gain coefﬁcient in silicon is 10 3–104times larger than that in glass ﬁbers. the third order nonlinear suscepti- bility in silicon, arising from the raman and non-resonant susceptibilities, is dom-inated by the raman contribution. in these devices, phase matching of the interact- ing beams is critical for the device efﬁciency. a modest mismatch of 10 cm −1(or ∼2×10−4in modal index) can degrade the stokes power conversion efﬁciency by 20 db [ 87]. in four-wave-mixing, the phase mismatch is mainly caused by the waveguide and material dispersion, and the birefringence between the pump and (anti-) stokeswaves. it was shown that waveguide geometry can be adjusted so that /delta1n geocom- pensates for the dispersion terms, thereby satisfying the phase matching condition [25,87]. maintaining the mismatch to below 1.3 cm−1, however, requires width and etch depth control of 70 and 10 nm, respectively, even for the relatively large waveguide of h=w=2.3μma t h=1.38μm. in those analyses, only the geometrical contributions were considered. stress-induced birefringence can be uti- lized to mitigate these stringent requirements [ 24]. with reference to discussions in sects. 2.3.1 and2.4.3 , one can observe that the waveguide cross-section can be designed to geometries less sensitive to dimensional ﬂuctuations (e.g., w>hand shallower etch), and employ stress-induced birefringence to reach phase matching. recently, active tuning of the cladding stress was demonstrated using a piezo- electric cladding layer [ 17,88]. lead zirconate titanate (pzt) sandwiched in pt/ti electrodes were deposited on the soi waveguides with an oxide spacer, as shown in figs. 2.25a, b. a linear dependence of the birefringence on the bias voltage was observed, and a tuning range of 1 ×10−4was obtained by varying the bias voltage from−10 to 5 v [ 17], as shown in fig. 2.25c. a corresponding efﬁciency tuning of 6 db was demonstrated in the coherent anti-stokes raman scattering (cars)wavelength conversion process. optimization in waveguide designs and fabrication processes are predicted to further improve the efﬁciency and offer adaptive control of waveguide nonlinear processes.2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 63 fig. 2.25 (a) scanning electron microscope image of the soi waveguide with the pzt capacitor on top; ( b) the enlarged cross-section of the pzt capacitor. the waveguide has a width of 1.5 μm, rib height of 2 μm, and slab height of 1.1 μm. the oxide-cladding is 500 nm thick. the pzt thickness is 500 nm. both top and bottom pt/ti electrodes are 100/10 nm thick. ( c) phase mismatch ( leftaxis) and the corresponding birefringence ( right axis) of the soi waveguide due to the piezoelectric effect in pzt as a function of dc voltage (after tsai et al. [ 17]) 2.5.6 stress-induced pockels electro-optic effect in silicon the last example in this section introduces a strain-induced active phenomenon in silicon, i.e., the pockels electro-optic effect which prescribes that the materialrefractive index varies linearly as a function of the external applied electric ﬁeld. although it is not a direct use of stress for polarization control, the pockels effect and photoelasticity are two intimately related phenomena. the pockels effect, as foundin materials such as linbo 3and gaas, is the basis for most commercially success- ful high-speed electro-optic modulators. being a centro-symmetric cubic crystal in its natural state, silicon lacks the inversion asymmetry which is necessary for thepockels effect. it was discovered in 2006 by jacobsen et al. that the inversion symmetry in silicon can be broken by applying asymmetric strains to the crystal. depositing astraining si 3n4layer of 1 gpa compressive stress on top of a silicon photonic crystal waveguide, as shown in fig. 2.26, introduced a second order nonlinearity χ(2)[89]. the phenomenon was observed in conjunction with the enhancement of apparent nonlinearity by the high group index in the photonic crystal waveguides used in the experiments. an enhanced nonlinearity of ∼830 pm v−1was observed, and a material nonlinearity of χ(2)≈15 pm v−1was deduced. this value is still much lower than that of linbo 3(∼360 pm v−1), nonetheless the experiment constitutes a decisive step towards making silicon a versatile electro-optic material. figure 2.27 shows the simulated stress and strain in a sub-micron silicon waveg- uide by applying a cladding ﬁlm with a high compressive stress ( σﬁlm=− 1g p a )o n half of the waveguide. the stress level is the same as in the work shown in fig. 2.26. the waveguide deformed non-uniformly and anisotropically, and the strain level in the silicon core can reach more than ∼1%. this is another possible conﬁguration to introduce inversion asymmetry in the silicon core. stress levels on the order of −1gpa are very high values for dielectric layers deposited on silicon. using epitaxially grown sige material, a stress of several gpa is common due to a 4% lattice mismatch between the silicon and germanium64 d.-x. xu fig. 2.26 (a) waveguide fabricated in the top layer of an soi wafer.

applying ﬁlm has σﬁlm=− 1g p a crystals. this high strain is widely used in the microelectronic industry to enhance the electron or hole mobilities in cmos devices, by applying strain in different crys- tal orientations through selective growth of sige in localized areas. even though not yet experimentally investigated, applying sige to the soi waveguide and exploringthe effect for waveguides along different crystal orientations may be a promising direction to enhance the electro-optic coefﬁcient in silicon. 2.6 conclusions birefringence in soi waveguides is governed by the waveguide cross-section and the stress in the silicon core. a stress in the core can be introduced on purpose or inadvertently by the waveguide upper cladding ﬁlms. the associated birefringence is important for a wide range of commonly employed soi waveguide sizes andgeometries. the signiﬁcance of these stress-induced effects is now being recognized in the research community, and the technique is also being applied by industry in product development. if not taken into consideration, these effects can lead tolarge deviations in device characteristics from the designed speciﬁcations. fortu- itously, cladding stress-induced birefringence is of comparable order of magnitude to the waveguide geometrical birefringence, allowing precise compensation of the2 polarization control in silicon photonic waveguide components 65 total birefringence. this affords a considerable degree of freedom in designing soi waveguides to meet other performance criteria such as relaxed dimensionaltolerance, reduced loss at waveguide bends, and overall improved device perfor- mance. the technique of cladding stress engineering is simple to implement and requires no additional process step other than the conventional cladding layer depo-sition. the stress-induced modiﬁcations to the effective indices and birefringence are readily controlled by the stress level and the thickness of the upper cladding layer. we have reviewed the application of cladding stress engineering to producepolarization-independent performance in several types of photonic components, including awgs, ring resonators, dpsk demodulators, and low loss triplexers. since the effect of the cladding stress on the mode proﬁle is negligible, there is littlemode mismatch loss or polarization-dependent loss at the junctions between waveg- uide sections with and without the upper cladding. therefore, tailored cladding patches can be applied at discrete locations in a planar waveguide circuit with negli-gible insertion loss and pdl penalty, as demonstrated in the example of a broadband polarization splitter. active tuning of birefringence has also been demonstrated using a piezoelectric cladding ﬁlm to enhance the conversion efﬁciency in optical parametric processes. on a related subject, cladding stress can be applied to break the inversion symmetryof the silicon crystal and introduce a pockels electro-optic effect. this area holds much promise in making silicon a truly versatile photonic material. cladding stress engineering can be envisioned in a variety of situations to enhance device function-alities, simplify fabrication, and improve operation tolerance. acknowledgments the author gratefully acknowledges dr. siegfried janz, dr. winnie ye, dr. pavel cheben, dr. andré delâge, and dr. philip waldron

thourhout abstract exploiting the high refractive index contrast achievable on the silicon-on- insulator (soi) material platform enables a drastic scaling down of the footprint of integrated optical functions. while this allows for large-scale integration of optical functions, it severely complicates the interfacing with a single-mode optical ﬁber, due to the huge mismatch in mode size between the optical ﬁber and nanophotonicsilicon waveguide. in this chapter we elaborate on the use of diffraction gratings to achieve an efﬁcient, compact, alignment-tolerant, polarization-independent, and broadband optical coupling. besides using these components as an interface with anoptical ﬁber, its use to interface with opto-electronic components will be discussed. finally, an optical probe will be presented, based on a diffraction grating integrated on the facet of a single-mode ﬁber. such an optical probe allows testing of individualcomponents in a silicon-on-insulator nanophotonic integrated circuit. 3.1 nanophotonic soi waveguide circuits silicon-on-insulator (soi) is emerging as the most important platform for large- scale photonic integrated circuits. this is due to the high refractive index contrast between the silicon waveguide core and sio 2or air cladding. this huge refractive index contrast allows a drastic reduction in the size of individual optical functions, bringing large-scale integrated optical circuits closer to reality. moreover, these photonic integrated circuits can be fabricated using standard cmos technologyon 200-mm or 300-mm wafers [ 1]. this allows for low-cost mass manufacturing and leverages from the billion dollar investments done in the development of stable g. roelkens ( b) photonics research group, department of information

of the use of high refractive index contrast waveguide systems likesilicon-on-insulator, it severely complicates the interfacing with an optical ﬁber. this is clear from the huge mismatch between the modal area of a single-mode optical ﬁber ( ≈100μm 2) and that of a nanophotonic monomode waveguide ( ≈0.1 μm2). this is perhaps one of the most important issues that high-index contrast waveguide circuits face for practical applications. 3.2 solutions to the fiber-chip coupling problem various solutions to the ﬁber-chip coupling problem have been proposed in the literature. the most common solution implies the use of a spot size converter to transform the size of the mode of the nanophotonic waveguide to that of the opti- cal ﬁber. in principal, a three-dimensional adiabatic taper structure can be usedfor this purpose, both laterally and vertically transforming the size of the silicon waveguide [ 2]. the technology required to do this is, however, not cmos compat- ible, thereby compromising its use in practical applications. a second approach tochange the spot size on the photonic integrated circuit is to use a lateral inverted taper structure. in these structures, the width of the silicon nanophotonic waveguide is tapered down to sub 100-nm dimensions (which can be achieved using state-of-the-art deep uv lithography used in cmos fabrication), thereby expanding the size of the optical mode. by realizing a low refractive index waveguide on top of this inverted taper structure, very efﬁcient coupling can be obtained between thenanophotonic waveguide and the low refractive index waveguide [ 3]. however, to interface with a single-mode ﬁber, this requires a low refractive index waveguide with cross-sectional dimensions comparable to that of the single-mode ﬁber core.this approach therefore suffers from two important drawbacks: the integration of such a large core optical waveguide requires a huge topography (to cmos stan- dards) on the photonic integrated circuit, compromising further processing. more- over, to adiabatically transform the mode from a nanophotonic silicon waveguide to such a large core waveguide would require taper structures of thousands of microm-eters in length, thereby canceling out the advantages of using a high-index contrast waveguide system for increasing the density of optical functions on the soi chip. this is why in current implementations, the use of inverted adiabatic taper structuresis limited to interfacing with a lensed optical ﬁber, since this reduces the topogra- phy on the integrated circuit to about 3 μm (which is still large, but manageable) and reduces the taper length to hundreds of microns, a more typical length scale inhigh-index contrast waveguide circuits. this approach allows for a high efﬁciency (an insertion loss lower than 1 db has been shown) and large optical bandwidth (typically several hundreds of nanometers) coupling between a lensed ﬁber and ananophotonic integrated circuit [ 3]. it however requires the use of specialty opti- cal ﬁber and the associated small alignment tolerances. besides the requirement of a specialty optical ﬁber, maybe the most important issue with this approachis the requirement of a cleaved and polished facet to interface with the photonic3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 73 integrated circuit. while this is the standard approach for current photonic integrated circuits (like planar lightwave circuits, edge-emitting laser diodes, etc.), the adventof large-scale photonic integrated circuits requires a ﬁber coupling approach that does not require singulated chips for optical interfacing, e.g., for optical testing on a wafer scale, comparable to the wafer scale electrical testing in electronic integratedcircuits. therefore the use of a new type of optical interface between a standard single- mode ﬁber and nanophotonic waveguide circuit using diffractive grating structureswas proposed [ 4]. in these coupling structures, the lateral adaptation of the mode size is achieved by a conventional in-plane taper structure. the interfacing with the optical ﬁber, however, is done by redirecting the light exiting the photonic integratedcircuit out of the plane of the photonic integrated circuit, using a diffraction grating (vice versa for optical coupling to the photonic integrated circuit). in this way the optical ﬁber interfaces with the silicon photonic integrated circuit from the top, nolonger requiring a singulated chip for coupling. this approach even enables packag- ing on the wafer level, by integrating ﬁber alignment structures on the wafer level. these two aspects, namely the possibility of wafer scale testing and wafer level packaging of photonic integrated circuits, could enable a dramatic reduction in the cost of the photonic integrated circuit, since these are two of the most cost-intensiveoperations in the whole fabrication cycle of the device. in the subsequent sections we will outline the operation principle, the design and the experimental realization of high efﬁciency, wide band and polarization independent grating coupler structures.we will show that, besides their use as ﬁber-chip couplers, they can also be used to interface a silicon photonic integrated circuit with a (ﬂip-chipped) opto-electronic component. in fig. 3.1, the three approaches discussed above for ﬁber-chip coupling are schematically depicted. fig. 3.1 comparison of two spot-size converter approaches (3d adiabatic tapering in ( a), lateral inverted tapers in ( b)) to interface with an optical ﬁber and ( c) the diffractive grating based coupling 3.3 fundamentals of fiber-chip diffraction grating couplers in its most simple form, a diffractive grating coupler consists of a one-dimensional periodic structure deﬁned on or in the silicon waveguide layer (later on we will showthat also two-dimensional periodic structures can be used), as shown in fig. 3.2a.74 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout fig. 3.2 fundamental operation principle of a one-dimensional diffraction grating structure: (a) device layout, ( b) geometric representation of the projected bragg condition, and ( c) the expo- nential decay of the diffracted ﬁeld proﬁle the periodicity implies that light is diffracted from these structures in preferential directions. this can be understood by looking at the one-dimensional grating struc- ture as a collection of scatter centers (located at the interface between the slits andteeth of the grating), which have a ﬁxed phase relation due to the periodicity of the structure. this ﬁxed phase relation results in a strongly angle-dependent interfer- ence. for inﬁnitely extending periodic structures, this interference behavior can bemathematically described by the projected bragg condition k z,m=βmode+mk (3.1) with man integer. in this formula kz,mis the z-component of the wave vector of the diffracted wave of the mth order (which arises due to the fact that all scat- ter centers interfere constructively in a particular direction). βmode is the effective wave vector of the optical mode in the silicon grating. in low-index contrast grating structures this is approximately the propagation constant of the guided mode in theuncorrugated waveguide section. in a high refractive index contrast structure this perturbation analysis is no longer valid and the effective propagation constant is an average of the propagation constant of the guided mode in the unetched and etched3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 75 waveguide region. kis the reciprocal lattice vector of the periodic structure. its length is given by k=2π λwithλthe period of the diffraction grating. the projected bragg condition directly determines the angle of diffraction, since kz=2πnsinθ0 λ, with nthe refractive index of the medium in which the diffracted wave is propagating. therefore the diffraction angle θ0is determined by sinθ0=neff(λ) n+mλ nλ(3.2) sinceβmode=2πneff(λ) λ. the right hand side of this equation has to be in between −1 and 1 for diffraction to occur. by properly choosing the grating period λ(for a givenλ,neff(λ)andn) one can realize a grating in which diffraction occurs into only one diffraction order, i.e., only the diffraction order m=− 1 is present. this is the preferred situation for the ﬁber-chip grating couplers, which we will describe in this chapter, since it allows efﬁcient collection of the light diffracted from the grating, bypositioning the single-mode optical ﬁber on top of the grating structure at an angle corresponding to the diffraction angle of this single diffraction order. a geometrical representation of this projected bragg condition is shown in fig. 3.2b. the choice of the diffraction angle depends on the particular application. typ- ically an angle between 8 and 15 ◦off vertical is chosen. the reason why an off- surface normal coupling angle is chosen becomes clear from the bragg diffraction.to obtain the condition of perfectly vertical coupling to the chip, the length of the reciprocal lattice vector has to obey k=β mode (3.3) since m=− 1. although this condition indeed produces only a single order of diffraction into the superstrate, a second-order reﬂection also occurs, back into the waveguide, since kz,−2=βmode−2k=−βmode (3.4) the second-order reﬂection toward the photonic integrated circuit is unwanted and reduces the coupling efﬁciency to the optical ﬁber. therefore a slightly off- normal operating grating coupler is typically used (a so-called detuned grating),since in this case no second-order bragg reﬂection occurs. in sect. 3.7, we will elaborate on how this performance reduction for vertical incidence can be avoided, for the integration of surface emitting opto-electronic components on the siliconphotonics platform. the bragg formalism described above is only valid for inﬁnitely extending struc- tures. in the design of the ﬁber-chip grating couplers, one has to take into account theﬁnite (or at least the semi-inﬁnite) nature of the diffraction grating. when the optical mode in the silicon input waveguide is exciting the diffraction grating, optical power is coupled out of the waveguide layer during the propagation due to diffraction76 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout (besides some scattering at the interface between the access waveguide and the grat- ing, due to a slight mismatch between the waveguide mode and the grating mode).this results in an exponentially decaying diffracted ﬁeld proﬁle (different from the plane wave considered in inﬁnitely extending structures). this exponentially decay- ing ﬁeld proﬁle, as shown in fig. 3.2c has two consequences: ﬁrst of all, it can be considered as a superposition of plane waves that propagate at an angle θcentered around θ 0, with an amplitude distribution a(θ)determined by the fourier transform of this exponentially decaying ﬁeld proﬁle. the extent of the angular distribution ofthese plane wave components is therefore inversely proportional to the decay length of the diffracted ﬁeld. this implies that a grating with a strong refractive index contrast (resulting in a short decay length) generates a whole range of plane waves.since the angle θ 0only varies slowly with wavelength (typically 1◦/10 nm), a large optical bandwidth coupling can be realized in high-index contrast grating structures, which will be discussed in more detail in sect. 3.5. a second consequence of the exponentially decaying diffracted ﬁeld proﬁle is the fact that there is a mismatch with the gaussian ﬁber mode in a single-mode optical ﬁber. this limits the achiev- able ﬁber coupling efﬁciency for a uniform grating structure. these aspects will be discussed in the following sections. so far, the inﬂuence of the polarization of the incident light has not yet been con- sidered. due to the high refractive index contrast obtained in silicon-on-insulator waveguide circuits, these waveguides show a strong modal birefringence. this implies that the diffraction angle for transverse electric and transverse magneticpolarized light is substantially different, making these one-dimensional diffraction gratings very polarization dependent. in sect. 3.6we will describe, however, how we can utilize this strong polarization dependence to realize a polarization diversityapproach based on two-dimensional diffraction gratings, effectively rendering the photonic integrated circuit polarization independent. for the one-dimensional grat- ing structures described in the subsequent sections, transverse electric (te) polar-ized light is always assumed, with the dominant electrical ﬁeld component oriented along the grating lines. 3.4 high-efﬁciency fiber-chip grating couplers simply calculating the overlap between the exponentially decaying ﬁeld proﬁle and the gaussian mode proﬁle of a single-mode ﬁber (with a 1/ e2intensity mode ﬁeld diameter of 10 .4μm) shows that there is an optimal decay length in the diffracted ﬁeld proﬁle of l=7.6μm, for which the overlap integral is maximal [ 4]. this results in a minimal insertion loss of about 1 db for uniform grating couplers. while this theoretical minimal loss can be improved by the use of non-uniform diffrac- tion gratings, where the coupling strength of the grating structure varies along thegrating, this is not considered in this chapter, since it requires the deﬁnition of fea- tures which cannot be deﬁned and/or well controlled by state-of-the-art deep uv lithography.3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 77 while there is a 1 db theoretical limit in the achievable ﬁber coupling efﬁciency for one-dimensional uniform diffraction grating structures, there is another, moreprominent, loss mechanism in these devices. so far, we have only considered the light that is diffracted toward the optical ﬁber. however, since the refractive index of the buried oxide layer, separating the silicon waveguide layer from the siliconsubstrate, has a comparable index to that of the superstrate (either air, sio 2or index matching glue), diffraction also occurs toward the silicon substrate, as is clear from fig. 3.2. this limits the directionality of the grating structure (being deﬁned as the ratio of the optical power diffracted toward the optical ﬁber to the total diffracted optical power). in a basic diffraction grating structure, where the one-dimensional grating is deﬁned by etching in the silicon waveguide layer, typically a 50% direc-tionality is obtained, implying that only a maximum coupling efﬁciency of −4d b (−3 db from the limited directionality and −1 db from the mode proﬁle mismatch) can be obtained. therefore, tackling this problem is, in a ﬁrst phase, more criticalthan trying to match the mode proﬁles. to improve the directionality, we envisaged two types of solutions, schematically outlined in fig. 3.3. in one type of solution, the downward diffracted light from the grating was redirected upward by integrating a mirror below the grating structure. both a metallic mirror and distributed bragg reﬂector mirror were considered. whilein this case a very high directionality is obtained, care has to be taken to optimize the distance between this bottom mirror and the grating. this is due to the fact that the fig. 3.3 schematic outline of the different strategies pursued to realize high efﬁciency ﬁber-to-chip grating couplers: ( a) the standard – moderate efﬁciency – grating coupler structure with the grating lines directly etched in the silicon waveguide layer, ( b) the metallic and ( c) dbr type bottom mirror approach, and ( d) the silicon overlay approach78 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout optical ﬁeld reﬂected on the bottom mirror will interfere with the directly upward diffracted wave. this interference modiﬁes the coupling strength of the grating (i.e.,when there is destructive interference between both diffracted waves, little light will be coupled out of the grating and hence the coupling length will be very long). since one still needs to obtain a grating coupling length matched to the dimensions of thesingle-mode optical ﬁber, care has to be taken in optimizing these structures. device optimization of the bottom mirror grating structures was performed using ﬁnite difference time domain (fdtd) and eigenmode expansion methods. to limitthe required computational resources, simulations are limited to two-dimensional simulations. this is a good approximation for one-dimensional ﬁber-chip grating couplers, since the waveguides are in practice 12 μm wide (i.e., 24 material wave- lengths) to interface with a single-mode ﬁber. while this shows that the diffracted ﬁeld proﬁle coming from a two-dimensional simulation corresponds well to the full three-dimensional simulation, still a correction factor of 0.97 (on a linear scale) inthe ﬁber-chip coupling efﬁciency needs to be taken into account, due to the slight mismatch in lateral ﬁeld proﬁle between the silicon waveguide mode (approximately cosinusoidal) and the gaussian ﬁber mode. in fig. 3.4a and b, the electric ﬁeld com- ponent (for te polarized light) of the diffraction in each type of optimized grating structure is plotted. both a metallic bottom mirror-based ﬁber-chip grating coupler [ 5] and a dbr bottom mirror-based ﬁber-chip grating coupler [ 6] were experimentally realized. for the metallic mirror approach, a 50-nm-thick layer of gold was used. the bot-tom mirror diffraction grating was realized used a wafer bonding approach. in fig. 3.4 simulation results for the optimized grating structures for the different strategies pursued to realize high efﬁciency ﬁber-to-chip grating couplers: ( a) gold bottom mirror approach, ( b)d b r type bottom mirror approach, and ( c) the silicon overlay approach3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 79 this approach a uniform one-dimensional grating structure was deﬁned on an soi waveguide wafer using the standard lithography and etching processes. afterwardsa polymer (dvs-bcb) spacer layer was applied, after which the gold mirror is deﬁned on top of the grating coupler structure. finally, the waveguide layer is trans- ferred to a silicon carrier wafer substrate using a dvs-bcb bonding technique.after removal of the silicon substrate, using the buried oxide layer as an etch stop layer, the grating structure is accessible from the top by an optical ﬁber. while this approach allows the integration of a bottom mirror below a crystalline siliconwaveguide layer, the layer transfer process required to achieve this is not standard cmos technology. therefore, a dbr bottom mirror approach was considered, building up the dbr/waveguide layer stack by means of chemical vapor depositionof silicon dioxide and amorphous silicon (a-si) on a 200-mm wafer scale. in this case a two pair sio 2/a-si dbr mirror was used. the experimentally obtained ﬁber coupling efﬁciency was in both cases about −1.5 db, approaching the theoretical limit of a uniform one-dimensional grating structure. the 1 db optical bandwidth of these coupling structures is approximately 35 nm. in fig. 3.5, microscope images and sem images of the fabricated grating structures are shown, together with the experimentally obtained ﬁber coupling efﬁciency spectrum. as is clear from these results, a dramatic improvement in coupling efﬁciency can be obtained comparedto a standard, directly etched grating coupler. the parameters of these fabricated devices are listed in table 3.1in the appendix to this chapter. fig. 3.5 microscope image and sem cross-section image of the fabricated high-efﬁciency grating coupler structures based on a bottom mirror approach, together with the experimentally obtainedﬁber coupling efﬁciency spectrum: ( a) the metallic bottom mirror approach [ 5]a n d( b)t h ed b r bottom mirror approach [ 6]. the dbr consists of two 112-nm-thick a-si layers with a 267-nm layer of sio 2in between80 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout while the integration of a bottom mirror allows for high-efﬁciency couplers, the drawback is that either a wafer bonding approach is needed or that the silicon waveg-uide layer is an amorphous silicon layer (e.g., problematic for the integration of high speed modulators). therefore, another approach was investigated allowing for high- efﬁciency coupling to a crystalline silicon waveguide layer, in which only cmostechnology is used for the fabrication. the mechanism here to realize high-efﬁciency coupling is to intrinsically modify the grating directionality by modifying its design. the proposed fabrication procedure consists of the deﬁnition of a silicon overlaymesa in the area where the grating will be deﬁned, prior to etching the grating lines [7]. while the optimal design originated from a pure optimization process, the oper- ation principle of the device can be understood as follows. modifying the design ofthe grating by having this silicon overlay allows the grating to be designed in such a way that the different scattering centers (which have a ﬁxed phase relation) interfere constructively in the direction of the optical ﬁber while destructive interference isobtained toward the substrate. hence, an enhanced directionality can be obtained. besides the high directionality, the coupling length also needs to be optimized to match with the dimensions of the gaussian ﬁber mode (unless a lens system is used to transform the waist of the gaussian beam as in [ 9]). both requirements can be achieved by optimizing the silicon overlay thickness and grating etch depth. sim-ulations show that in this way efﬁciencies close to the −1 db theoretical coupling limit can be obtained. high-efﬁciency diffraction gratings based on the silicon overlay approach were fabricated using cmos technology. the silicon overlay was deﬁned using silicon epitaxial growth in an opened sio 2mask layer. experimentally, a coupling efﬁ- ciency of −2.6 db was obtained with a 1 db optical bandwidth of 50 nm [ 8]. this is below the expected −1 db coupling efﬁciency due to the fact that the fabricated device dimensions deviated from the designed ones. taking into account the dimen- sions of the actual fabricated structure, an excellent agreement is obtained betweenthe two-dimensional fdtd simulations and the experimentally obtained ﬁber cou- pling spectrum, strengthening our belief that with an optimized fabrication process a−1 db coupling efﬁciency is obtainable. sem images of the fabricated structures and the experimentally obtained ﬁber coupling efﬁciency spectrum are shown in fig. 3.6. the device parameters are listed in table 3.1. while the optimal grating layer thickness is on the order of 350–400 nm, the optimal waveguide layer thick- ness still is lower (about 220 nm) in order to obtain a vertically single mode strip waveguide. 3.5 multi-band fiber-chip grating couplers the ﬁber-chip coupling structures that were outlined in the previous section all showa 1-db (3 db) optical bandwidth in the order of 40–50 nm (80–100 nm). while this is sufﬁcient for applications where only a single wavelength band needs to interface with the photonic integrated circuit, a set of applications require a more broadband3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 81 fig. 3.6 (a) sem images and ( b) measured ﬁber-chip coupling efﬁciency spectrum of a silicon overlay-based grating coupler [ 8] optical interface since optical signals in different wavelength bands need to be pro- cessed by the photonic integrated circuit. this is, for example, the case in integratedtransceivers for optical access networks, where both a 1,310 nm optical signal (i.e., for upstream at the subscriber side) and a 1,490/1,550 nm optical signal (for the downstream analog and digital signal) needs to be coupled to the photonic integratedcircuit. this type of application can also beneﬁt from the use of a diffraction grating to interface with an optical ﬁber. in this case both access waveguides to the one-dimensional grating structure are being used, as shown in fig. 3.7a[10]. this allows the diffraction grating to be designed such that the bragg condition is sat- isﬁed for both wavelength bands, by coupling one wavelength band in the for-ward direction and the second wavelength band in the opposite direction. this approach therefore allows not only to efﬁciently couple both wavelength bands to the photonic integrated circuit, it also realizes wavelength duplexing, whichis required, for example, in the integrated transceiver application. for optimal performance, all device parameters need to be optimized: ﬁber tilt angle, grat- ing period, grating etch depth, duty cycle, and number of grating periods. this can be achieved using dedicated optimization algorithms such as particle swarm or genetic optimization algorithms, written around the two-dimensional fdtdand eigenmode expansion simulations. the same methods as in the case of a single wavelength band grating coupler discussed in the previous section can be used to increase the ﬁber coupling efﬁciency. for example, using a siliconoverlay approach to increase the directionality of the grating structures allows realizing a coupling efﬁciency of about −2.5 db, for both a 1,310- and 1,490- nm wavelength as shown in fig. 3.7b. the respective 3 db optical bandwidth is 55 and 60 nm. an important issue for these grating duplexer structures, especially when they are used in an upstream/downstream conﬁguration, is the parasitic coupling of the (out-coupled) upstream wavelength channel into the downstream waveguide, resulting in cross-talk (see fig. 3.7a). while in a grating structure that is optimized for optimal coupling efﬁciency for both wavelength bands a substantial fraction of the light82 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout fig. 3.7 (a) concept of the one-dimensional grating duplexer structure and ( b) simulated device performance in a silicon overlay grating conﬁguration [ 10] (typically −10 db) is still coupled from the upstream waveguide channel into the downstream waveguide, this can be improved by incorporating a wavelength ﬁlter in the downstream wavelength path, in order to combine a high ﬁber-chip couplingefﬁciency and low crosstalk behavior. the combination of a one-dimensional grating duplexer and an optical ﬁlter to improve the crosstalk performance (and at the same fig. 3.8 (a) fiber-chip coupling efﬁciency spectrum for the one-dimensional grating duplexer for the upstream and downstream wavelength channel and ( b) a microscope image of the fabricated photonic integrated circuit including a one-dimensional grating duplexer and a planar concave grat- ing to split the downstream wavelength channels, while at the same time suppressing the upstream wavelength channel crosstalk to below −30 db [ 11]3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 83 time split the 1,490 and 1,550 nm wavelength channels) was experimentally realized [11]. in this case, a “standard” grating design was used by directly etching the grat- ing lines into the silicon waveguide layer. the wavelength ﬁlter was implemented as a planar concave grating ﬁlter, resulting in more than 30 db suppression of the upstream wavelength channel into the downstream wavelength path and demulti-plexing of the 1,490 and 1,550 nm wavelength channels. the fabricated photonic integrated circuit, together with the experimentally obtained ﬁber-chip coupling spectrum is shown in fig. 3.8. the device parameters of this device are again listed in table 3.1. 3.6 polarization independent fiber-chip coupling as described in sect. 3.3, silicon-on-insulator nanophotonic waveguides experience large modal birefringence, due to the high refractive index contrast of the wave- guides and the typical rectangular shape of the photonic wire. this implies thatone-dimensional diffraction gratings are inherently very polarization sensitive, since the diffraction angle for transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized light is substantially different. in most practical applications, however, the polarizationof the light in the input optical ﬁber is unknown and varying over time. while the lateral inverted taper discussed in sect. 3.2can be designed to allow for efﬁcient optical coupling for both transverse electric and magnetic polarization, still the pho-tonic components based on these silicon photonic wires behave very differently for both polarizations. this is a well-known issue in high-index contrast waveguide systems. the most popular solution to solve this problem is to use a polarizationdiversity approach. in this approach, both polarization states are spatially separated in the two arms of the polarization diversity circuit. in the case of a lateral inverted taper structure, ﬁrst the te and tm polarized light are spatially separated (e.g.,using a directional coupler structure). then the polarization in one of the arms of the polarization diversity circuit is ﬁrst rotated to the orthogonal polarization state, thereby allowing the use of identical high index contrast waveguide structures in both arms. however, before combining both arms of the polarization diversity circuit (using an identical polarization combiner structure such as a directional coupler), thepolarization needs to be rotated again in one arm [ 12]. while this approach enables polarization-independent operation of nanophotonic waveguide circuits (which are inherently very polarization dependent), it is clear that this requires several extraintegrated optical components (besides the additional requirement of a cleaved and polished facet for optical interfacing). because of these drawbacks, we pursued an approach based on diffraction grat- ings to achieve polarization-independent operation of high-index contrast photonic integrated circuits [ 13]. the basic idea is to realize a grating structure that is the superposition of two one-dimensional diffraction gratings. placing these two one-dimensional grating structures orthogonal to each other allows the coupling of both orthogonal polarization states in the optical ﬁber to the optical waveguide layer. moreover, the optical modes that are excited by these two orthogonal polarization84 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout states in the orthogonal waveguides have identical polarization (i.e., transverse elec- tric polarization), no longer requiring separate polarization splitter and polarizationconverter waveguide structures. the superposition of two identical one-dimensional grating structures leads to a square lattice grating for interfacing with the optical ﬁber. therefore, a photonic integrated circuit can be made to work in a polarizationindependent way by incorporating two such square lattice grating structures on a photonic integrated circuit and duplicating the optical functions in both arms of the polarization diversity circuit. the concept of this polarization diversity approachand the operation principle of the square lattice grating structure is schematically shown in fig. 3.9. while this is conceptually an easy way to realize polarization-independent oper- ation, two important issues complicate its actual realization. first of all there is the need for identical photonic integrated circuits in both arms of the polariza- tion diversity conﬁguration, which is also the case for the edge-coupling method.although state-of-the-art deep uv lithography is used, this is far from trivial to achieve. it turns out that deep sub-nanometer dimensional control is required to match for example the resonance frequencies of a silicon ring resonator (a rule of thumb says that one nanometer variation in waveguide dimension results in a one nanometer wavelength shift). one way to tackle this problem is to thermo-opticallytune the photonic integrated circuits, to compensate for the non-uniformity. in some applications, however, it is possible to use a single optical component for both arms of the polarization diversity circuit, by passing the light through the device in oppo-site directions. this mechanism is not limited to the diffraction grating approach and can be used in all polarization diversity approaches. this device concept was demonstrated for the case of polarization independent operation of an soi arrayedwaveguide grating [ 14] and ring resonator structure [ 12]. another difﬁculty speciﬁc to the two-dimensional grating coupler implementation is the fact that the previous reasoning pointing to a square lattice grating structure as a polarization independent fig. 3.9 concept of the two-dimensional square lattice grating as ( a) a polarization independent interface to the optical ﬁber and ( b) the polarization diversity conﬁguration3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 85 coupler is, in principle, only valid for a perfectly perpendicular positioned optical ﬁber. however, in sect. 3.3we pointed out that perfectly vertical positioning of the optical ﬁber results in strong second-order bragg reﬂection and associated reduced ﬁber coupling efﬁciency. therefore, a tilt of the optical ﬁber is still required to interface with a two-dimensional grating structure. to preserve the symmetry ofthe polarization diversity circuit, this tilt should be along the bisection line of the diffraction grating. this tilt has two implications. first, tilting the optical ﬁber along the bisection line of the two-dimensional grating implies that the waveguides con-nected to this grating structure also need to be tilted inwards, as is clear from the projected bragg condition k z,i=kin,proj+ki (3.5) with i=1,2 and k1=2π λ1x,k2=2π λ1y. since kin,proj=2πn λsin(θ0)(√ 2 21x+√ 2 21y) (3.6) wave vectors kz,1andkz,2are no longer orthogonal to each other, as can be seen in fig. 3.10. this can however easily be implemented in the design of the integrated circuit by tilting the access waveguides inwards (i.e., 3 .1◦tilt for a 10◦tilted ﬁber). a more important issue associated with this tilting is the fact that a perfect polarization independent coupling can no longer be obtained. this can be understood by looking at the polarization in the optical ﬁber along the bisection line of the grating andthe orthogonal polarization. by tilting the optical ﬁber, the polarization along the bisection line is tilted out of the plane of the photonic integrated circuit, while the orthogonal polarization stays in this plane, as shown in fig. 3.11a. this implies fig. 3.10 calculation of the non-orthogonal wave vectorsin the silicon waveguide layerdue to the ﬁnite projectedwave vector of the incident light arising from the tilting of the optical ﬁber86 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout that the coupling spectrum for both polarizations will be different when the ﬁber is tilted off vertical, resulting in an intrinsic polarization-dependent loss (pdl) ofthe grating structure. this is conﬁrmed by rigorous three-dimensional fdtd sim- ulations (see fig. 3.11b), showing the presence of a wavelength-dependent pdl. this wavelength-dependent pdl is also observed in the experiment, as shown infig. 3.11c. the parameters of the grating coupler structure are listed in table 3.1. while this wavelength-dependent pdl arises due to the tilting of the optical ﬁber, improvement can be expected by optimizing the design of the grating structure. thisrequires however extensive three-dimensional fdtd simulations and has not been studied in detail so far. recently we studied another approach to realize a polarization-independent inter- face to a silicon photonic integrated circuit, using a one-dimensional grating struc- ture [ 15]. in this case, the same mechanism as described in sect. 3.5is used to interface with both polarizations on the photonic integrated circuit, as shown infig. 3.12a. although this allows one to couple both polarizations to the photonic integrated circuit (and spatially separate them on the chip), the modes in the waveg- uides still are te and tm polarized, respectively. this means that a polarization rotator is still required to realize a true polarization diversity scheme. in this case, the grating coupler fulﬁlls the role of ﬁber-chip coupler and polarization splitterat the same time. in some applications, the need for a polarization converter is not fig. 3.11 tilting of the optical ﬁber and its inﬂuence on the polarization-dependent loss: (a) schematic, ( b) rigorous fdtd simulation of the polarization dependence of the coupling efﬁ- ciency, and ( c) experimentally obtained polarization dependent loss as a function of the wavelength3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 87 even required. this is, for example, the case for a point-to-point transceiver in which the downstream wavelength only needs to be coupled to the chip in a polarization-independent way, where it is immediately detected. by optimization of the grat- ing structure, polarization-independent coupling of the downstream wavelength and single polarization coupling of the upstream wavelength using a one-dimensionalgrating structure can be realized at the same time. this was recently demonstrated using a standard diffraction grating approach for polarization-independent coupling of a 1,310 nm wavelength signal and single polarization coupling of a 1,610 nmwavelength signal. the operation wavelength of the device is deﬁned both by the grating period and angle of the optical ﬁber, although the waveguide layer thick- ness and grating etch depth also play a signiﬁcant role. because the device geom-etry was ﬁxed, the important wavelength combination of 1,310/1,550 nm could not be reached, although a slight modiﬁcation in waveguide geometry and etch depth allows one to do so. the operation principle of this device was demonstrated usingstandard diffraction grating structures (a 220-nm-thick silicon waveguide layer and a 70-nm etch depth for the grating). a coupling efﬁciency of −5.9 db for the 1,610 nm wavelength channel was obtained, while a −5.2 db coupling efﬁciency was obtained for 1,310 nm, which is independent of the polarization of the incident light. the ﬁber-to-ﬁber polarization dependent loss measured using this device conﬁguration islower that 1 db over a broad wavelength range of 70 nm. the ﬁber-to-chip coupling efﬁciency for both wavelength channels and the polarization dependent loss of the fig. 3.12 a one-dimensional diffraction grating for polarization independent coupling

used in the experiment are listed in table 3.1. 3.7 integration of opto-electronic components so far we have discussed the use of diffraction gratings as a means to interface with a single-mode optical ﬁber. the use of grating couplers is however not restricted to this application: interfacing with hybrid integrated iii–v opto-electronic com- ponents can be envisioned as well. in this case, these opto-electronic components need to be ﬂip-chipped on top of the diffraction gratings. however, one particular aspect of the diffraction gratings needs to be considered with care. in sect. 3.3 we elaborated on the fact that diffractive grating structures only perform well for oblique diffraction. otherwise, second-order reﬂection and reduced coupling efﬁ- ciency occur. while this is not a problem for a ﬂip-chipped photodetector (or at leastcan be taken into account in the design), this is a serious issue for vertically emitting laser diodes, like vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (vcsels). although there are ways to ﬂip chip components in a tilted fashion, this is not the standard approach.therefore, to interface a vcsel with a silicon photonic integrated circuit, a modi- ﬁed grating layout is required. one approach we have pursued to solve this problem is the modiﬁcation of the grating structure by adding either a grating at the backside of the coupling grating functioning as a high-reﬂectivity grating [ 4], or adding an additional slit at the front side of the grating, acting as an anti-reﬂection type coating [ 16]. both approaches create an asymmetry in the grating design allowing the efﬁcient coupling of light from a ﬂip-chipped vertically emitting light source into the photonic circuit. while this approach allows realizing a high vcsel-chip coupling efﬁciency, there still is aparasitic reﬂection from the grating that couples back into the vcsel light source. this is an unwanted situation, since it will increase the noise of the laser diode and can even result in polarization switching of the device. therefore, an alternative approach was investigated. in this case, an obliquely operating grating coupler structure is used, as discussed in the previous section. tointerface with the opto-electronic component, a wedge can be deﬁned on top of the grating structure to refract the light to the surface normal direction, as shown in fig. 3.13a. this approach has several advantages. first of all, standard diffrac- tion gratings optimized for high-coupling efﬁciency can be used. moreover, due to the presence of the wedge, the inﬂuence of specular reﬂection into the laser cavity is signiﬁcantly reduced, yielding a more stable solution. this approach ofintegrating a wedge on top of the diffraction grating has recently been demonstrated [17]. in this case, a polymer wedge was deﬁned on top of the grating structures by means of a nanoimprint lithography technique, as shown in fig. 3.13b. standard diffraction gratings were used as proof-of-principle components. the performance of these grating coupler structures was assessed by probing the wedge/grating com- bination using a vertically positioned single-mode ﬁber and comparing the cou-3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 89 fig. 3.13 integration of a polymer wedge on top of diffractive grating couplers for interfacing with a vcsel light source: ( a) fdtd simulation, ( b) sem picture of the fabricated structure, and (c) measured ﬁber-to-ﬁber coupling efﬁciency after a thermal cycle at 300◦c for 10 min [ 17] pling efﬁciency thus obtained to the oblique coupling efﬁciency on a reference grating coupler without the wedge structure. only a marginal penalty in device performance was observed, showing that wedges with good optical quality can be obtained. to emulate the ﬂip-chip integration process and the inﬂuence this processhas on the device performance (due to the relatively high temperatures used), the polymer wedge/grating coupler combination was exposed to a 300 ◦c temperature cycle of 10 min. both the conﬁgurations based on su-8 (microchem) wedges andpak polymer (toyo gosei) wedges showed no appreciable degradation in device performance, as is clear from fig. 3.13c. 3.8 small footprint fiber-chip coupling structures while the grating coupler structures presented in the previous sections are very com- pact (typically 12 by 12 μm in size), a relatively long adiabatic taper is still needed to laterally transform the optical mode size from that of a single-mode ﬁber (10 μm) to that of a single-mode nanophotonic waveguide (0.5 μm). this taper, on the order of 150μm in length, determines the footprint of the ﬁber-chip coupling structure. since one of the advantages of working on a high refractive index contrast waveguide platform is the density of integration that can be obtained, it would be interesting to90 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout be able to scale down the footprint of the ﬁber-chip coupling structure. this can be achieved by modifying the layout of the grating structure. instead of using straightgrating lines in a one-dimensional grating structure, a curved grating can be used to couple the light from the ﬁber to the waveguide plane and at the same time focus the light in that waveguide plane onto the aperture of the optical waveguide. whenthe waveguide plane is chosen to be the (y,z)plane of a right-handed cartesian coordinate system, with zalong the waveguide axis and the origin chosen to be in the desired focal point, it can be shown that a focusing grating can be obtained bycurving the grating lines according to qλ 0=neff√ y2+z2−zntcos(θc) (3.7) here, qis an integer number for each grating line, θcis the angle between the ﬁber and the chip surface, ntis the refractive index of the environment, λ0is the vacuum wavelength, and neffis the effective index felt by the cylindrical wave in the broad waveguide with the grating. the grating lines are ellipses with a common focal point, that coincides with the optical focal point of the coupler. while rigorousdesign of the focusing gratings would require full three-dimensional simulations, we approximate by extrapolating two-dimensional designs of standard linear gratings for te-polarization (electric ﬁeld parallel to the grating lines) and coupling at θ c= 80◦. this way, the use of curved grating structures to reduce the device footprint was demonstrated. we showed that by implementing these curved grating structures an eight-fold reduction in the device footprint is obtained without a penalty in deviceperformance [ 18]. besides the demonstration of a one-dimensional curved grating structure, the footprint of a two-dimensional ﬁber-chip grating coupler can also be scaled downby changing the grating layout. again the idea is to consider the two-dimensional grating as the superposition of two one-dimensional curved gratings. at the inter- section of both one-dimensional curved grating lines, a hole is etched in the silicon fig. 3.14 the implementation of compact one-dimensional and two-dimensional curved gratings [ 18]3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 91 waveguide layer, acting as a scatter center. also in this way, ultra-compact polariza- tion independent coupling to a silicon-on-insulator waveguide circuit was demon-strated without penalty in device performance compared to a standard square lattice two-dimensional grating structure [ 18]. a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional curved grating structure is shown in fig. 3.14. 3.9 optical probing of nanophotonic integrated circuits one of the major drivers to use a diffraction grating is the need for interfacing non- singulated chips with an optical ﬁber. this enables wafer-scale testing of large-scale photonic integrated circuits, comparable to the wafer-scale electronic testing forcmos circuits. since both electrical probing and optical probing can be done from the top of the wafer surface, both types of measurements can be combined in a single measurement system, in the case of electronic/photonic integrated circuits.this approach allows using a modiﬁed probing station to do a fully automated map- ping of the device performance across the wafer. this, however, only allows the characterization of the input-output characteristics of the full photonic integratedcircuit, since it is only at the optical input/output ports of the circuit that these grat- ing couplers can be implemented. in the development stage of a photonic integrated circuit, device engineers typically would like to access the individual componentsin the actual integrated circuit. therefore, there is the need for a true optical probe, which allows one to do so, without the need for a diffraction grating on the photonic integrated circuit. the approach we followed for such an optical probe is, instead of deﬁning the diffraction grating on the photonic integrated circuit, to implement a high refractive index contrast grating on the facet of a single-mode optical ﬁber [ 19]. by making physical contact between this probe and an input/output waveguide of an individ- ual component of the integrated circuit, a grating coupler is formed allowing the coupling of light to and from the photonic integrated circuit. a prototype ﬁber probe was realized by deﬁning a uniform metallic periodic structure on the core of a single-mode ﬁber, by means of an imprint technology. first, the ﬁber withuv-curable resist on the facet is aligned over a specially prepared mold carrying t h e1 0b y1 0 μm gold grating pattern in the mold trenches. the mold was obtained by starting off from an soi sample containing silicon gratings of 630 nm period andan etch depth of 220 nm. this surface was treated with an antistiction coating. then, gold was evaporated onto the mold. finally, the gold on top of the mold grating lines was selectively removed by microcontact printing on another substrate. in this way,the original soi mold becomes a carrier of the gold grating pattern by leaving the gold only in the grating trenches. after attachment of the ﬁber to the mold, the cavities are ﬁlled and the resist is uv cured. finally, the mold is released. the metalgrating is now attached to the ﬁber. the fabrication process is schematically outlined in fig. 3.15a together with an sem picture of a fabricated device, while fig. 3.15b92 g. roelkens and d. van thourhout fig. 3.15 the optical probe: ( a) probe fabrication and sem image of a transferred grating onto a ﬁber facet and ( b) artist’s impression of how the optical probe is used to probe individual integrated optical functions [ 19] shows an artist’s impression of how this optical probe is used to assess the properties of individual components on a photonic integrated circuit. two gold grating ﬁber probes were fabricated, both consisting of a gold grating of 20 nm thickness. both probes were brought into contact with a straight 220 nm by 3μm soi waveguide. a 15% coupling efﬁciency and a 1-db bandwidth of 38 nm was demonstrated in this way for transverse electric polarized light, which is sufﬁ-cient for testing purposes. 3.10 conclusions diffractive grating structures provide an elegant way of interfacing a high refractive index contrast single-mode ﬁber and a nanophotonic integrated circuit. polarization- independent, large optical bandwidth, high-efﬁciency coupling can be obtained.even duplexing of two wavelength bands can be realized using the same type of structure. as diffractive grating structures allow accessing a photonic integrated circuit, it paves the way to wafer scale testing of photonic integrated circuits andwafer level packaging of photonic integrated circuits. in this chapter the main focus was on the interfacing of a single mode ﬁber and a photonic integrated cir- cuit. we showed, however, that it is possible to also interface hybrid integratedopto-electronic components such as ﬂip-chipped photodetectors and vcsels with the photonic integrated circuit, allowing the realization of complex active/passive photonic integrated circuits. finally, an optical probe has been presented, creating3 interfacing integrated circuits and optical fibers with diffraction gratings 93 the possibility to assess the performance of the individual subcomponents forming the photonic integrated circuit. acknowledgments we would like to thank dr. dirk taillaert, dr. frederik van laere, dr. wim bogaerts, dr. jonathan schrauwen, dr.

they lag other photonic components in their level of development. in this chapter, er used as an optical dopant and utilizing its intra-4f transition at 1.54 μm will be introduced as a viable means for on-chip light generation that has the advantage of being compatible with long-distance telecom as well. first, a general introduction to the topic of developing a si-based/compatible light source will be presented, with emphasis on the need for a novel high-index material for er-doping that can provide both a higher er content and refractive index than has been reported so far. second, er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitride (srsn) and ersilicates will be introduced as a promising host material for compact on-chip light sources. finally, results of fabricating basic photonic components using er-doped srsn and er-silicates will be presented. 4.1 introduction 4.1.1 si photonics and light sources in the developing ﬁeld of si photonics, great strides have been made in developing compact active photonic devices such as ultra-fast modulators [ 1,2], optical buffers [3], and detectors [ 4,5] that seemed impossible just a few years ago. by leveraging the astronomical infrastructure for si processing, these devices hold the promise of achieving an electronic-photonic convergence on a si platform that can overcomethe “interconnect bottleneck.” j.s. chang, k. suh,

light source has so far been lacking, as no amount of advanced processing can overcomethe fundamental limitation on light emission imposed by the indirect bandgap of si. in a semiconductor, light emission typically involves recombination of an electron with a hole. as the momentum of a photon is negligible when compared with thecrystal momentum of carriers in a semiconductor, electrons and holes need to have the same wave-vector, k, if their radiative recombination is to occur efﬁciently. this is the case for iii–v compound semiconductors such as gaas, whose valence bandmaximum and conduction band minimum both occur at the central /gamma1point of the ﬁrst brillouin zone. in case of si, on the other hand, the conduction band minimum occurs along the [100] direction of the ﬁrst brillouin zone. therefore, a third parti-cle – such as a phonon – is required to supply the extra momentum, which greatly reduces the probability for radiative recombination of carriers in si. thus, one obvious method of increasing the luminescence efﬁciency of si is to suppress all other competing carrier recombination paths by starting with ultra-high purity si wafers, and then thoroughly passivating all defects and surfaces. using this approach, green et al. have reported that si light-emitting diodes (leds) can be made to luminesce as efﬁciently as conventional leds based on iii–v compound semiconductors [ 6]. another well-established method of increasing the lumines- cence efﬁciency of si is to use si nanostructures such as quantum dots and wires. use of si nanostructures modiﬁes the light emission properties of si in several important ways. first, the bandgap is increased due to the quantum conﬁnementeffect, leading to luminescence in the visible range [ 7]. second, the radiative tran- sition probability can be greatly increased [ 8]. finally, the formation of individual nanocrystals (ncs) results in physical isolation of non-radiative defects, leadingto an enhanced overall luminescence efﬁciency [ 9]. in fact, it had been reported that while the ensemble average of si ncs luminescence efﬁciency can be quite low due to defective si ncs that do not luminesce, the luminescence efﬁciencyof individual luminescent si ncs can be very close to 100% [ 10]. since the ﬁrst report on light emission from porous si by canham et al. [ 11], intense research into the subject of light emission from si nanostructures has provided a wealth ofimpressive results, including the fabrication of visible leds and their integration with electronic circuits [ 12], photonic crystal leds [ 13], and optical gain under optical pumping [ 14,15]. yet despite the many impressive developments and the elegance of a monolithic all-si electro-photonic convergence, the direct use of si for light emission presentsseveral difﬁculties. first, light emitted by si is also absorbed by si. thus, the use of si for a light source precludes its integration with developed si electro-photonic devices, nearly all of which use the silicon-on-insulator (soi) platform. second,carrier recombination in si remains indirect even for nanometer-sized clusters [ 16]. thus, the high radiative efﬁciency is obtained under low-power or ultra-short pump- ing conditions only, as non-linear effects such as auger-recombination quickly dom-inate under the high excitation conditions necessary for population inversion and lasing. this presents difﬁculties for the use of a si-based light source for inter- and intra-chip communication applications that require high bandwidth and fast modu-lation speed.4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 97 high bandwidth and efﬁciency under high excitation conditions can be obtained by use of compound semiconductors dedicated for light generation. the traditionalapproach of heteroepitaxy of a compound semiconductor thin ﬁlm on si has the limitations imposed by the lattice mismatch. however, recent development in wafer- bonding technique may offer the possibility of wafer-scale integration of compoundsemiconductor photonic devices with si electronic circuits regardless of their lat- tice mismatch [ 17]. still, whether such a method can be used to reliably scale to cmos production lines has yet to be determined. we note that there have beenrecent reports that strain-engineered ge grown heterepitaxially on si can be used for both the generation and detection of light at the technologically important wave- length range of 1.54 μm. [18]. at this moment, more research is needed before the feasibility of a ge-based light source can be ascertained. but if successful, such ge-based light source would have the advantage of easy wafer-scale fabrication with full cmos compatibility. 4.1.2 er as an optical dopant an approach that is quite different from the ones discussed so far is the use of eras an optical dopant for si. the important point that sets er-doping apart from other approaches is that even when er is doped into a host, the light emission occurs via intra-4f-shell electronic transitions within the atom without involving carriers in thehost matrix. these transitions are parity-forbidden, but occur due to the effects of the crystal ﬁeld. this gives rise to stable luminescence properties and long lumi- nescence lifetimes that allow easy population inversion. furthermore, as these arecore-level transitions, the overall luminescence properties are affected only weakly by external factors such as the host material and temperature. in particular, since the intra-4f transition from the ﬁrst excited state to ground state emits light at the stan-dard telecommunication wavelength 1.54 μm, use of er enabled the development of er-doped ﬁber ampliﬁers (edfa) that have enabled the realization of all-optical long-distance optical telecom networks [ 19]. the most direct way of exciting er 3+ions in any host material is through direct resonant optical pumping with a pump beam tuned to one of the higher opticalabsorption bands of er 3+. on the other hand, in the case of a semi-conducting host material, it is possible to excite er3+ions indirectly via energy transfer from carriers to the 4f electrons [ 20,21], as shown schematically in fig. 4.1. in particular, si could be used as an effective host material since its bandgap of 1.1 ev provides sufﬁcient energy for excitation of 4f electrons of er3+, yet provides complete transparency to emitted 1.54 μm photons. furthermore, using si allows one to leverage the vast si processing infrastructure and technological know-how as well, enabling a cost- effective large-scale production. these factors, together with the great success of edfa in telecom applications, have led to investigation of er-doping of si as aviable means of developing an on-chip si-compatible light source. since the ﬁrst work by ennen et al. [ 22], a great explosion of research into er doping of si has led to demonstrations of not only photoluminescence (pl) but also electroluminescence(el) at room temperature from er-doped si [ 23,24].98 j.s. chang et al. fig. 4.1 schematic description of ( a) direct resonant optical excitation of er without nc-si sensi- tization; ( b) indirect carrier-mediated excitation of er with nc-si sensitization despite such success, er-doping of bulk si remains impractical because er can react with si to form non-luminescent conﬁgurations [ 25], and because excited er3+ ions can back-transfer energy to the host electrons, resulting in a strong temperature quenching of er3+luminescence in si [ 26]. these problems, however, can be solved by co-doping er with activating ligands such as oxygen [ 25,27] and using a host material with a wide bandgap [ 28]. thus, silicon-rich silicon oxide (srso), which consists of nanocluster-si (nc-si) embedded inside an sio 2matrix, has emerged as an attractive host material that in effect combines the efﬁcient er3+excitation properties of si with the well-known and stable luminescent properties of er3+in sio 2[29–34]. in this case, nc-si plays the role of classical sensitizers that efﬁciently absorb pump photons with a large absorption cross-section, then transferring it tonearby er 3+ions. this process can be surprisingly efﬁcient, with a transfer time of ≤1μs−1and transfer efﬁciency of ≥55% [ 35], and by now, efﬁcient light emit- ting diodes [ 36] as well as signal enhancement under optical pumping have been demonstrated [ 37,38]. yet srso, in attempting to combine the best of si and sio 2, can also combine the worst of si and sio 2. er-doped srso is usually formed by annealing er-doped amorphous sio xboth to precipitate excess si into nc-si and to optically activate er [29–34]. within this annealing process, er atoms can both diffuse and react with excess si, leading to a loss of optically active er, as is observed for er-doped bulk si, and to breaking of the nc-si/er coupling necessary for nc-si sensitization. [39–41]. there have been several reports that the number of er atoms in srso that can be excited via nc-si in srso can be very small – as low as only a few percent of the doped er atoms – and that in many cases, less than half of the total er can be excited at all, even with direct optical pumping [ 42], thereby pre- cluding the possibility of optical inversion necessary both for lasing and optical ampliﬁcation. these issues are serious, but with the selection of proper materials and processing conditions, solutions may still be found. indeed, there already exist several reports that a great improvement can be obtained by reducing the excess si content and the4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 99 annealing temperatures [ 37]. however, even then, the use of srso – or, in fact, any sio 2-based host material – for a compact on-chip light source faces fundamental difﬁculties due to (1) the low solubility of er in sio 2, and (2) the low refractive index contrast achievable against possible cladding materials. first, because the light emission occurs via the atomic intra-4f transition, the amount of light thatcan be generated is limited strictly by the number of optically active er 3+ions. yet the concentration of optically active er that can be doped into silica without clustering is limited to ∼1020cm−3[43]. given that the emission cross-section of er3+is 10−21–10−20cm2, this limits the maximum gain that can be obtained by any sio 2-based material to a few db/cm at most. thus, obtaining a net gain from such a material will require a large device and/or highly advanced processing techniques toreduce any parasitic losses. second, for a stable operation in integrated devices, all photonic devices need outer cladding layers. however, because the refractive index of srso is very close to that of sio 2with/delta1n≤0.1, it requires waveguides with a width >1μm, a bending radius >100μm, and an areal footprint >108μm2for a 3 db gain, as shown in fig. 4.2[44]. these values do not present any problem for stand-alone telecom devices, but are unacceptably large for electro-photonic inte- gration. indeed, it is instructional to realize that the only reported case of an on-chip light source based on er-doped silica required a micro-disk resonator of 120- μm diameter with air-cladding [ 45]. fig. 4.2 (a) plot

constant device lengths and constant device gain. from [ 44] 4.1.3 silicon-rich silicon nitride and er silicates in this chapter, silicon-rich silicon nitride (srsn) and er silicates will be introduced as novel materials that can solve the above problems, and enable development of a compact efﬁcient light source based on er.100 j.s. chang et al. nitrides were chosen for several reasons. first, nitrides are used widely in the si industry, and thus are fully cmos compatible. second, they have refractiveindices that are much higher than that of oxide and can be controlled by varying the silicon content, thereby allowing compact optical devices on a chip without requiring cladding layers that are several microns thick. third, nitrogen has beenreported to be even more effective than oxygen in optically activating er in si [ 27], indicating that nitrides may offer an efﬁcient environment of er 3+luminescence. finally, nitrides have a bandgap that is much smaller than that of oxide, which wouldallow easier injection of current for the possible development of electrically excited devices [ 46]. we ﬁnd that nitrides do indeed offer all of the above advantages, and, in addition, are much more resistant to er clustering, such that higher er concentrationsand annealing temperatures can be used. we note that there have been several recent reports on er-doped srsn that conﬁrm the results presented here [ 47]. er silicates present an interesting solution to the problem of low solubility of er. by raising the er concentration high enough, er-rich crystalline rare-earth oxy- orthosilicates (r 2sio 5,r2si2o7, etc), which are stable phases in the sio 2–r2o3 system, can form [ 48]. they provide a combination of a very high concentration of optically active rare earth ions in a stable material, as the crystalline structure prevents clustering of er on the atomic scale. in fact, the maximum possible er3+ ion concentration is 2 ×1022cm−3for er 2sio 5, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of silica. furthermore, they have a high refractive index of about 1.825 [ 49], enabling compact optical devices with footprints that are only 1/70th of that of comparable silica-based devices. however, their compatibility with standard si processes still needs to be resolved. we ﬁnd that er silicates can indeed offer a much higher er concentration than is possible elsewhere. the maximum er con-centration that can be used is limited by cooperative upconversion. still, the coop- erative upconversion coefﬁcient of er silicates are much lower than that expected from silica-based thin ﬁlms, demonstrating the promise of er silicate thin ﬁlms forhigh-gain compact light sources. finally, the applicability of er-doped srsn will be demonstrated by fabricating high-q microdisks, which can form the basis for many important photonic com-ponents such as switches, ﬁlters, and light sources, and characterizing their optical performance. 4.2 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitride 4.2.1 experimental srsn:er ﬁlms of ∼100 nm thickness were deposited on si substrates by means of the ultra high vacuum (uhv) ion beam sputter method using a 750 ev n+beam from a kaufmann-type ion gun. the base pressure of the system was 1 ×10−8 torr, and the stoichiometry of deposited ﬁlms was controlled by varying the n 2 gas ﬂow rate. the composition of the ﬁlm was calibrated by in situ x-ray pho- toelectron spectroscopy (xps) and rutherford backscattering (rbs) analysis. the4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 101 excess si content ranged from 0 (pure si 3n4) to 17 at.%, while the er content was ﬁxed at 0.09 at.% for all ﬁlms. after deposition, the ﬁlms were furnace-annealedat 300–1,100 ◦c for 30 min in a ﬂowing n 2environment to precipitate nc-si [ 50] and activate er. a subsequent anneal at 650◦c in forming gas for 1 h was used to hydrogenate the ﬁlm and passivate defects. for comparison, srso:er and sio 2:er thin ﬁlms of similar thickness, excess si content, and er content were also prepared using identical procedures. the photoluminescence (pl) spectra were obtained using either the 477-nm line of an ar laser or a 980-nm distributed feedback (dfb) laser diode. the 477-nm line excites er3+ions via nc-si only, as it is non-resonant with optical transitions of er3+, while the 980-nm dfb laser excites er3+ions via direct optical absorp- tion only, as it is resonantly absorbed by er3+ions but is hardly absorbed by nc-si [51]. the low temperature pl spectra were measured using a closed-cycle helium cryostat, and the luminescence decay traces were measured using a digitizing oscil-loscope. finally, photoluminescence excitation (ple) spectroscopy was performed using a xe lamp (450 w) dispersed by a monochromator with 18-nn resolution. 4.2.2 results and discussion figure 4.3a shows the refractive indices of deposited srsn:er thin ﬁlms, as mea- sured by ellipsometry. we ﬁnd that they all have refractive indices in excess of 2.0in the visible range. by extrapolating the measured refractive index to the near-ir range using a single-pole sellmeier equation, we estimate the refractive index at 1.54μm to be in excess of 2.1 for all ﬁlms considered (data now shown). however, the srsn ﬁlms remain highly transparent in the near-ir range. this is shown in fig. 4.3b that shows the absorption coefﬁcient of an srsn ﬁlm with excess si content of 9 at.%. a clear absorption band edge near 650 nm can be observed. fig. 4.3 (a) the refractive index of srsn:er thin ﬁlms, as measured

displayed the maximum pl intensities. stoi- chiometric sio 2and si 3n4:er show very little er3+pl, indicating that the presence of excess-si is necessary for er3+sensitization for nitrides as well. in the case of srso:er, the er3+pl intensity reaches a maximum near an excess si content of 6 at.%, and decreases strongly as the excess si content is increased further. in the case of srsn:er, a much higher excess si content is needed for nc-si sensitizationto occur, and the maximum er 3+pl intensity is reached near an excess si con- tent of 12 at.%. note that the er3+pl intensity from srsn:er is lower than that from srso:er, which seems to indicate that nc-si sensitization is less effective in srsn:er. that is not the case, as will be shown later. the effect of excess si content on the er3+luminescence lifetimes is shown in fig. 4.4b. again, all samples were annealed at 950◦c. we ﬁnd that for both srso:er and srsn:er, increasing the excess si content leads to a reduction of the er3+luminescence lifetimes. in case of the srso:er ﬁlm, the reduction in the er3+lifetime is quite drastic, as it decreases from nearly 3.7 to 1.5 ms as the excess si content is increased by 1 at.% from 3 to 4 at.%. as the excess si content is increased further, the er3+luminescence lifetime decreases further to 0.97 ms. in case of srsn:er, on the other hand, increasing the excess si content from 0 all the way to 17 at.% results in a reduction in the luminescence lifetime from 3.2 to 1.4 ms only, indicating that the reduction of the er3+luminescence efﬁciency by excess si is much less severe in srsn, and can result in a luminescence efﬁciency that is even slightly higher than that in srso:er.4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 103

the er3+pl intensity and lifetimes from srsn:er. we ﬁnd that neither the pl intensity nor the luminescence lifetimes from srsn:er show any signiﬁcant temperature quenching, similar to what hasbeen reported for srso:er [ 52]. the results so far seem to indicate that while nc-si sensitization does occur in srsn:er, it is not much different from, and does not possess a great advantage over,srso:er in almost every way, especially when compared at the optimum condition of 6 at.% excess si for srso:er and 12 at.% excess si for srsn:er. such, however, is not the case when we compare the effect of increasing the annealing temperaturebeyond the optimum temperature of 950 ◦c. as shown in fig. 4.6a, we observe a clear reduction of er3+pl intensity above the anneal temperature of 950◦c, reﬂect- ing the previously reported effect of er clustering [ 12] and optical de-activation in the presence of nc-si [ 20]. as shown in fig. 4.6b, no such effect is observed from srsn:er, as the er3+pl intensity remains stable even after an anneal at 1,100◦c. a clear difference that highlights the advantage of srsn:er, however, emerges in their er3+ple spectra monitored at the er3+pl peak position of 1,535 nm, as is shown in fig. 4.7. also shown for comparison is the ple spectrum from stoichiometric sio 2:er. the sharp kink near 490 nm is an optical artefact of the measurement system. in the case of sio 2:er, we clearly observe peaks at 380, 405, and 525 nm corresponding to4i15/2→4g11/2,4i15/2→2h9/2, and4i15/2→2h11/2 direct optical transitions, respectively [ 53]. on the other hand, both srso:er and srsn:er ﬁlms show broad continuous ple spectra, reﬂecting the broadband absorption spectrum of nc-si. note, however, that the nc-si sensitized er3+pl intensity from the srsn:er ﬁlm is much higher than that from the srso:er ﬁlm below the pump wavelength of 500 nm. near the pump wavelength 350 nm, at which the nc-si sensitized er3+pl is at the maximum for both srsn:er and srso:er, the nc-si sensitized er3+pl intensity from the srsn:er ﬁlm is more than four times higher than that from the srso:er ﬁlm. part of the reason for the higher er3+pl intensity from srsn:er at shorter pump energies can be attributed to the larger bandgap of nitride-passivated nc-si. the effect of surface passivation on the “bandgap” of nc-si is well-documented104 j.s. chang et al. fig. 4.6 (a) the effect of annealing temperature on nc-si sensitized er3+emission from srso:er. note that the er3+pl intensity decreases for annealing temperatures above 950◦c; (b) the effect of annealing temperature on nc-si sensitized er3+emission from srsn:er. the er3+pl intensity remains stable even after an anneal at 1 ,100◦c [54], and it has been reported by several investigators that nitride passivated nc-si shows visible luminescence at wavelengths that are much shorter than that from oxide-passivated nc-si [ 55], and that host-sensitized excitation of a rare earth doped into nitride thin ﬁlms requires pump wavelengths in the near uv range [ 56]. still, the larger bandgap of nitride-passivated nc-si does not explain the larger er3+pl intensity near the pump wavelength of 350 nm, when er3+pl intensities from both srso:er and srsn:er are saturated. in fact, the higher er3+pl inten- sity from srsn:er is observed regardless of nc-si sensitization. this is shown in fig. 4.8, which shows the er3+pl spectra of the same ﬁlms obtained under 980 nm4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 105 fig. 4.7 the photolumines- cence excitation (ple)spectra of

optical excitationusing a 980-nm laser excitation. as nc-si sensitization is negligible at 980 nm [ 51], the er3+pl observed in this case is due to the direct optical excitation of er3+ions only. furthermore, as the er luminescence lifetimes from srso:er and srsn:er are similar as well,the differences in pl intensities under direct optical pumping reﬂect the fraction of optically active er 3+ions. we ﬁnd that er3+pl intensity from srsn:er is higher than that from srso:er even when excited directly. in fact, it is higher than eventhat from sio 2:er, which is often considered to be the standard for er doping, and has an er luminescence lifetime in the excess of 5 ms (data not shown). a detailed quantitative comparison of pl intensities from different ﬁlms can be difﬁcult due to the possibility of refractive index-dependent optical artefacts [57]. however, the advantage of nitrides for er-doping is real, as is further demon- strated in fig. 4.9, which shows the anneal temperature dependence of the 980 nm pumped er3+pl intensity. we ﬁnd that the er3+pl intensity from both srso:er and sio 2:er decreases abruptly as the annealing temperature is increased beyond 950◦c, in agreement with previous reports of clustering and optical de-activation of106 j.s. chang et al. fig. 4.9 the anneal-temperature dependence of the er3+pl intensity of srsn:er, srso:er, and sio 2:er, obtained under resonant optical excitation using a 980-nm laser. note the decrease in the er3+intensity from srso:er and sio 2:er thin ﬁlms at anneal temperatures above 1 ,000◦c, indicating optical de-activation of er as distinct from de-coupling of er from nc-si er in silica at high temperatures [ 43]. in the case of srsn:er, however, the er3+pl intensity under resonant optical pumping keeps increasing with increasing anneal temperature, indicating that such optical de-activation of er3+is greatly suppressed in nitrides. indeed, the er3+pl intensity from the srsn:er ﬁlm after an anneal of 1,100◦c is nearly two times larger than that from the optimized sio 2:er ﬁlm. the exact reason for such thermal stability of srsn:er against optical de- activation of er at high temperatures is not clear, but it is consistent with reports that metal diffusivity in nitrides is much lower than that in silica [ 58]. as atomic motion of both er and si is necessary for their reaction and subsequent optical de-activationof er, suppression of er diffusion in nitrides is consistent with the observed reduc- tion of optical-deactivation of er in srsn even after high temperature annealing. for the purpose of er doping, however, the implication of such suppression of opti-cal de-activation of er in nitrides is signiﬁcant, as it opens up the possibility of a much greater degree of freedom in designing a nc-si sensitized er-doped si thin ﬁlm for use in optically active devices without needing to compromise betweeneffective nc-si sensitization and maintaining the optical activity of er. 4.2.3 conclusion in conclusion, we have investigated the luminescence property and thermal stability of erbium-doped silicon-rich silicon nitride. we ﬁnd nitrides offer both more effec- tive nc-si sensitization and much higher thermal stability for optically active er thanoxides, provided that higher pump energy is used to take into account the larger bandgap of nitride-passivated nc-si. the results show that srsn:er is a promising alternative to srso:er for a compact, low-cost si-based light source.4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 107 4.3 er silicates 4.3.1 experimental er silicates were formed by coating a dense array of si nanowires (si-nw) with a solution prepared by dissolving either pure ercl 3·6h2o or a mixture of ercl 3·6h2o and ycl 3·6h2o in ethanol followed by rapid thermal annealing at high tempera- tures. si-nws were grown by the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism [ 59,60] using an au catalyst deposited on si (111) substrates by sputtering. during growth, sicl 4was introduced into the growth furnace held at 900◦c by bubbling h 2carrier gas through liquid sicl 4held at 0◦c at a ﬂow rate of 1–10 sccm. ar and h 2gas was also intro- duced into the furnace at a ﬂow rate of 100 sccm. the growth time was 20–30 min. after si-nw growth, a solution prepared by dissolving either pure ercl 3·6h2o or a mixture of ercl 3·6h2o and ycl 3·6h2o in ethanol was spin coated on the si-nws at 4,000 rpm for 1 min. following spin-coating, a rapid thermal anneal atvarious temperatures and times were used to form the silicates. the use of si-nws is critical for uniform formation of silicates, as they provide the nanometer-sized diameter and large surface area that are better suited for chemical reaction andatomic transport between crystalline si and er solutions that are necessary for the formation of silicates [ 61]. dilution of the er with y was done in order to control the er concentration while keeping the crystalline structure constant, as y formssilicate phases that have nearly the same lattice constants as er silicates [ 62,63]. indeed, czochralski-grown er and yb co-doped y 2sio 5bulk crystals have been used successfully to fabricate solid state lasers [ 64]. table 4.1shows the weight and corresponding quantity in mol of ycl 3·6h2o and ercl 3·6h2o, both in solution and in the ﬁnal silicates as determined by eds. the structure of the resulting silicate ﬁlm was analyzed using ﬁxed angle ( θ) x-ray diffraction (xrd) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). pl spectra were obtained using either the 488-nm line of an ar laser or a 532-nm frequency- doubled nd:yvo4 laser, a grating monochromator, and employing the standard lock-in technique. note that in the case of silicates, excitation of er occurs via direct table 4.1 the weights and corresponding quantities in mol of ycl 3·6h2oa n de r c l 3·6h2o added to 2.0 g of ethanol. the actual concentrations of er in the ﬁnal

form nc-si that could sensitize er. we note, however, that er ions in silicates can also be non-resonantly excitedvia carriers, if a si layer can be made to intimately contact the silicate layers [ 65]. the pump beam size, as determined using a cmos image sensor, was 0.15 mm 2for the ar laser and 0.14 mm2for the frequency-doubled nd:yvo 4laser. the pl decay traces were collected with a digitized oscilloscope. all spectra were corrected for the system response. 4.3.2 results and discussion figure 4.10 shows a scanning-electron microscope (sem) image of as-grown si- nws at a tilt angle of (a) 45◦and (b) 90◦. we observe a dense array of straight si-nws of about 100 nm in diameter and ∼10μm in length with a si-nw density of 1.4×109cm−2. figure 4.11a shows the sem image of the sample that is spin-coated with pure er solution and then annealed. we ﬁnd that the si-nws have disappeared, and instead observe a “nano-bush” of roughly spherical grains. the formation of these grains is uniform across a large area, as is shown in fig. 4.11b. in fact, the entire wafer turns uniformly white to the naked eye (data not shown). the material phase of the “nano-bush” is identiﬁed by xrd analysis, as is shown in fig. 4.12. from the position of the diffraction peaks, we identify the “nano-bush” to consist of nearly pure er 2sio 5[62], which is a stable phase in the er 2o3–sio 2 system [ 66] with a monoclinic symmetry of space group p2 1/c. more details about the shape of the silicate grains can be found in fig. 4.13, which shows the tem images of the fabricated silicate thin ﬁlm. we ﬁnd that the ﬁlm consists of loose aggregates of er 2sio 5nanocrystals that are about 50–200 nm in diameter. the nanocrystal grains are randomly oriented, but are single-crystalline, as is shown by the high-resolution tem image shown in the inset. fig. 4.10 sem images of si-nws grown via the vls method for use in fabricating er silicates (a) at a tilt angle of 45◦,a n d( b) at a tilt angle of 90◦4

spectra of the er2sio 5nanocrystals, measured both at roomtemperature and at 25 k usingthe 488 nm line of an ar ionlaser to optically excite the 4i15/2→4f7/2transition of er3+ions. at 25 k, the width of the central peak at1,530 nm is limited by thesystem resolution, which is1.5 nm this formation of single-phase single-crystalline er 2sio 5nanograins is con- ﬁrmed from pl spectra as well. figure 4.14 shows the pl spectra of the er 2sio 5 nanocrystals, measured both at room temperature and at 15 k using the 488 nm line of an ar ion laser to optically excite the4i15/2→4f7/2transition of er3+ions. we ﬁnd that at low temperature, the pl spectrum is nearly atom-like with a series ofsharp peaks, consistent with the single-crystalline nature of the fabricated silicate nanograins. the width of the central peak at 1,530 nm is limited by the system resolution, which is 1.5 nm. even at room temperature, the central peak dominatesthe pl spectrum with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of less than 4.5 nm, or 3 mev . it should be noted here that the spectra are not intentionally offset – the er 3+pl intensity increases strongly as the temperature is raised. the peak intensity increases by 50%, while the integrated pl intensity increases more than sevenfold. such a sharp atom-like luminescence is not an inevitable byproduct of using a crystalline material. in many cases where a polycrystalline thin ﬁlm is used, the presence of grain boundaries and strain often results in a very large inhomogeneous broadening not only from er-doped polycrystalline al 2o3[67], but also from pure er2o3as well [ 68]. in contrast, no such inhomogeneous broadening is observed from the er 2sio 5ﬁlm investigated here as it consists of a loose aggregate of high- quality single-crystalline nanograins. we also would like to note that that obtainingpure single-phase silicate material requires a careful control over the processing conditions. for instance, if we change the spin-coating speed to 1,000 rpm such that more of the solution remains on the si nanowires, the resulting “nano-bush” consistsof a mixture of er 2sio 5and er 2o3grains, as is shown in fig. 4.15. given the er concentration of 25 at.% in er 2sio 5, the maximum possible gain from er 2sio 5would be in the excess of at least 200 cm−1. in reality, however, such a high concentration leads to cooperative upconversion (cu) that limits the possible gain [ 69–71]. figure 4.16 shows the schematic description of the cu process at the4i13/2energy level. the cu is a dipole-dipole interaction between (a) two er3+4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 111 fig. 4.15 room temperature pl spectra of ( a) pure er 2sio 5and er 2o3thin ﬁlms; ( b) er sili- cate thin ﬁlms formed by 4,000 and 1,000 rpm spin-coating. the one formed with 1,000 rpm spin coating shows peaks due to both er 2sio 5and er 2o3phases ions in the ﬁrst excited state, in which (b) an er3+ion in the ﬁrst excited state (4i13/2) decays non-radiatively to the ground state (4i15/2) by exciting another er3+ ion in the ﬁrst excited state to the third excited state (4i9/2), which then (c) ther- malizes rapidly to lower-lying states. indeed, such cu can also occur between anytwo excited states of er 3+. as cu annihilates one excited er3+ion without photon emission, it is an important loss mechanism that limits optical gain at a given pump power that needs to be investigated before the merits of er silicates can be fullydetermined. the effect of cu is investigated by observing the changes in the er 3+lumi- nescence properties as the er3+concentration is varied via y dilution. figure 4.17112 j.s. chang et al. er3+ er3+ 4i15/24i13/24i11/24i9/2er3+ er3+ 4i15/24i13/24i11/24i9/2

(jcpds) are also indicated. we observe identical spectra from all samples ranging from pure y 2sio 5to pure er 2sio 5, with peaks that agree well with the reported peak positions from jcpds [ 62]. figure 4.18 shows the near-infrared pl spectra from the fabricated nanocrystals, normalized to the intensity at 1.53 μm. the shape of the pl peak near 1.53 μm due to the4i13/2→4i15/2transition is the same for all er concentrations, and is very similar to pl spectra from pure er silicate thin ﬁlms, as shown above. as the intra-4f transitions of er3+are parity forbidden but become allowed by the crystal ﬁeld, the changes in the atomic environment of er are reﬂected in the details of theer pl spectrum shape. thus, the fact that we observe the same sharp pl spectra for all er concentrations, together with the xrd spectra shown in fig. 4.17, clearly demonstrates that the crystal structure of the fabricated er xy2−xsio 5nanocrystals is the same for all er concentrations, right down to the atomic level. note that, on the other hand, the pl peak near 0.98 μm due to the4i11/2→4i15/2 transition is observable only for an er concentration of 5.0 at.% or higher, even though the pump power was the same for all samples. a similar concentration dependence is shown in fig. 4.19a, which shows the decay traces of the 1.53 μm er3+pl intensity for different er3+concentrations. at an er3+concentration of 0.26 at.%, we observe a single-exponential decay with a luminescent lifetime of 7.4 ms. as the er concentration is increased further, the decay traces become non-exponential characterized by a fast initial decay. figure 4.19b shows the decay traces of the 1.53 μme r 3+pl intensity from the sample with 1.5 at.% er at different pump powers. at 2 mw pump power, the decay trace is a single-exponential, witha luminescent lifetime of 8 ±0.5 ms. as the pump power is increased, the decay fig. 4.18 the near-infrared pl spectra from the fabricated nanocrystals with various

( b) the time decay traces of the 1.53- μme r3+pl intensity from the sample with 1.5 at.% er at different pump powers traces become non-exponential with shorter lifetimes. we note, however, that all decay traces, after the fast initial decay, approach a single exponential decay with a luminescent lifetime of 7.4 ms. such a concentration-dependent 0.98 μme r3+pl intensity, together with the concentration- and pump-power-dependent 1.53- μme r3+pl decay traces, bears the hallmark of cu. in investigating cu in er xy2−xsio 5, we ﬁrst note that we do not observe a 0.98- μm pl peak at low er concentrations even though we are exciting the 4f electrons to the higher-lying4f7/2level by using the 488-nm pump beam. this indicates that the thermalization of the 4f electrons down to the4i13/2 level is very rapid, consistent with the high phonon energies reported for rare-earth oxyorthosilicates. [ 69,72] thus, we approximate the 4f electron distribution in low er3+concentration nanocrystals by a two-level model in which we consider the ground- and ﬁrst-excited states of er3+only [ 70]. in such a case, we can write dn(t) dt=σabsφ(1−n)−σemφn−n τ−cnn2(4.1) where n,σabs,σem,φ ,τ , c, and nare the fraction of er3+in the ﬁrst excited state, the absorption (excitation) cross-section, emission cross-section, pump photonﬂux, decay lifetime, cooperative upconversion coefﬁcient (cuc), and concentration of er, respectively. note that since we are using the 488 or 532 nm pump, the emis- sion cross-section at 1.54 μm is assumed to be 0. the analytic solution of eq.

( 4.2) and ( 4.3) to the luminescence decay curve and the pump power dependence of the 1.53 μme r3+luminescence intensity, provided that σandτ are known. forτ, we use 7.4 ms, which is the lifetime observed under conditions where cu is negligible. to obtain σ, we have measured the rise time of the 1.53 μm er3+pl from the sample with 0.26 at.% er at different pump powers, under the condition that no cu effects appear. the results are shown in fig. 4.20. the slope of the curve then gives σ, which was found to be (a) (4.5 ±0.2)×10−20cm2and (b) (2.3 ±0.1)×10−20cm2at 488 and 532 nm, respectively. this value is much higher than the value of ∼(2–3)×10−21cm2typically reported [ 9]f o rt h e4f7/2 level of er3+, which we attribute to the multiple scattering of the pump beam by nanocrystal aggregates. because of the multiple scattering, the effective excitation cross-section can vary from sample to sample, even though the true atomic excita-tion cross-section should be the same for all samples. to investigate the variation, we measured the er 3+pl properties from more than 30 samples with 2.5 at.% er and found the variation in the pl intensity to be about ±50% and the varia- tion of the er3+luminescence decay time to be ±10% (data not shown). based on these data, we calculate the excitation cross-section of er3+in er xy2−xsio 5to be (4.5±2.3)×10−20cm2at 488 nm and (2.3 ±1.2)×10−20cm2at 532 nm. figure 4.21 shows (a) the luminescence decay curve at the pump power of 650 mw and (b) the pump power dependence of the 1.53 μme r3+luminescence fig. 4.20 t h er i s et i m eo f 1.53μme r3+pl from the sample with 0.26 at.% er atdifferent pump powers at thepump wavelengths of 488 and532 nm, under the conditionthat no cu effects appear.the slope then gives theeffective excitationcross-section indicated116 j.s. chang et al. fig. 4.21 the luminescence time decay curve at a pump power of 650 mw and the pump power dependence of the 1.53- μme r3+luminescence intensity for 1.5 and 2.5 at.% er at the pump wavelength of 532 nm. the ﬁtting results of c=1.7×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.086 for 1.5 at.% er and c=5.1×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.049 for 2.5 at.% er (when σ=2.3×10−20cm2 is used) are shown by the solid curves intensity for 1.5 and 2.5 at.% er. by using a single set of parameters to ﬁt both curves to eqs. ( 4.2) and ( 4.3) with a σvalue in the range of (2.3 ±1.2)×10−20cm2, we obtain values of c=(2.2±1.1)×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.08±0.04 for 1.5 at.% er and c=(5.4±2.7)×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.05±0.03 for 2.5 at.% er. the ﬁtting results of c=1.7×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.08 for 1.5 at.% er and c=5.1×10−18cm3/s with n(0)=0.05 for 2.5 at.% er (when σ=2.3×10−20cm2 is used) are shown by solid curves in fig. 4.21 these values are very low, especially given the high er concentrations used. figure 4.22 shows the previously reported values of cuc [ 73], together with the fig. 4.22 reported values of the cooperative upconversioncoefﬁcient at the 4i13/2 energy level of er in various hosts from [ 73]. for comparison, the cooperativeupconversion coefﬁcientsobtained for er xy2−xsio 5 with 1.5 and 2.5 at.% er are indicated by ﬁlled circles4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 117 value of cuc obtained here. in case of er-doped silica, cwas reported to be as high as 1.7 ×10−17cm3/s at an er concentration of 1 ×1020cm−3.[74]av a l u e of 4×10−18cm3/s was reported for er-doped al 2o3, but at an er concentration of only 6 ×1019cm−3.[75] a lower value of 3 ×10−18cm3/s had been reported for ge/al doped fused-silica optical ﬁbers, but only at a low er concentrationof∼2×10 19cm−3.[76] a low value of 1.2 ×10−18cm3/s at an er concentration of 6×1020cm−3has been reported, but in the case of bulk soda-lime silicate glasses prepared from batches melted at 1,400◦c for as long as 50 h. [ 73]. in other words, the cucs obtained for er xy2−xsio 5nanocrystals are among the lowest ever reported, at an er concentration that is among the highest ever reported. such a low value of cis critical for efﬁcient optical ampliﬁcation at the high er concentrations necessary for compact optical ampliﬁers, and demonstrates the viability of using er xy2−xsio 5nanocrystals. the exact reason for such a low value ofcis not yet clear. we postulate, however, that the high crystalline quality of the fabricated er xy2−xsio 5nanocrystals is at least partially responsible, as the crystal structure of oxyorthosilicates has only two sites for rare earth ions that are separated by either a bridging oxygen or a sio 4tetrahedron [ 77], and thereby precludes the possibility of the formation of er clusters that are known to lead to high values of c.[71] in addition, the near-perfect lattice matching between er 2sio 5and y 2sio 5 allows dilution of er within the matrix without the formation of er 2sio 5domains. for ampliﬁer applications, it is more likely that either a 0.98 μmo r1 . 4 8 μm pump beam will be used. we can use eq. ( 4.3) to obtain the inversion curve under the 1.48 μm pump, as shown in fig. 4.23. the inversion level is deﬁned as the fraction of the population at the4i13/2state, n 2/n. in case of the 1,480 nm pump, stimulated emission as well as absorption of pump light should be considered. thevalues of absorption and emission cross-section of er in er xy2−xsio 5at 1.48 μm are obtained based on the peak absorption cross-section of er3+in er xy2−xsio 5 (∼1.1×10−20cm2)and the mccumber theory. the simulation results indicate that population inversion can be achieved at a pump intensity of 0.6 mw/ μm2, and fig. 4.23 the simulated inversion level as a functionof 1,480 nm pump intensityof er xy2−xsio 5with 1.5 and 2.5 at.% er in consideringonly cooperativeupconversion at the 4i13/2 state. here, we consider stimulated emission as wellas absorption of pump light,which limits the maximuminversion level to ∼0.7118 j.s. chang et al. 23 db/cm gain, corresponding to 70% inversion, can be achieved at a pump intensity of 6.5 mw/ μm2for 1.5 at.% er. even higher gain could be possible by using a higher er concentration. in 2.5 at.% er, population inversion can be achieved at a pump intensity of 2.2 mw/ μm2, and 38 db/cm gain, corresponding to 70% inversion, can be achieved at a pump intensity of 25 mw/ μm2. note, however, that we only con- sider the cooperative upconversion for the simulation result. the inclusion of other effects such as excited state absorption and higher order cooperative upconversion can lead to less than optimum results. furthermore, that the silicates need yet tobe fabricated in a dense continuous thin ﬁlm before they can be used for photonic devices, and it still needs to be determined whether such a dense thin ﬁlm will have the advantageous properties of nanograins. 4.4 applications of er-doped srsn: high-q microdisks 4.4.1 experimental a 330 nm thick er-doped a-sin xﬁlm (8–9 at.% excess si) with 0.2 at% (2×1020cm−3) er was deposited on si substrate at room temperature by means of the reactive ion beam sputtering deposition method using a combination of 600 ev ar+and n+beams. subsequently, a 280-nm-thick sio 2layer was deposited on the top to be used as a hard mask. after deposition, the ﬁlms were annealed at 950◦c for 30 min in a ﬂowing ar environment to both precipitate nc-si and activate er. finally, the ﬁlms were hydrogenated by a 30 min anneal in a ﬂowing forming gas environment (10% h 2/90% n 2) at 650◦c to passivate defects. the ﬁnished samples all showed strong er3+luminescence with a luminescence lifetime of 0.69 ms when pumped off-resonantly at 477 nm that did not coincide with any optical transitions of er3+ions, indicating both successful optical activation and nc-si sensitization of doped er ions. disk patterns 25.2 μm in diameter were formed using an els-7000 electron beam lithography system. afterwards, disks were formed by dry-etching using a combination of chf 3/o2gases in an inductively coupled plasma (icp). finally, an hno 3/hf wet etch was used to undercut the si layer and form a pedestal. 4.4.2 results and discussion figure 4.24 shows the sem image of the fabricated microdisk. the pedestal is 11μm high, with a center contact patch diameter of 5.2 μm. the surface rough- ness of the ﬁlm before and after the microdisk fabrication is shown in fig. 4.25. prior to microdisk fabrication, the ﬁlm is very smooth, with a root mean square (rms) roughness of 0.14 nm with a correlation length of 22.1 nm. after the fabri- cation process, the ﬁlm is much rougher, with an rms roughness of 1.15 nm witha correlation length of 25 nm. using the analytical expression derived by payne et al.

another factor that can contribute to scattering loss is the edge roughness. the sidewall roughness was measured by extracting the contour from a high-resolution sem image of the disk edge, as is shown in fig. 4.26. using the analytical expressions in [ 79] and [ 80] that relate edge roughness of a waveguide to scattering loss, we estimate that the edgeroughness will contribute an additional loss factor of about 1 db/cm. the|e| 2-ﬁeld distributions of the ﬁrst-order transverse electric-like (te) and transverse magnetic-like (tm) whispering gallery modes (wgm) of the fabri-cated microdisk, with azimuthal numbers of 79 and 60, respectively, simulated by the three-dimensional ﬁnite-difference time-domain (fdtd) method are shown in fig. 4.27. we ﬁnd that the te-like mode is conﬁned very strongly within the disk with a mode overlap of 0.94 ±0.01. such tight conﬁnement leads to a negligible radiation loss such that the theoretical q-factor greatly exceeds 10 6. note, however, the large mode overlap also leads to a large absorption by er. assuming a typicaler absorption cross-section of 0 .8×10 −20cm2[81] we expect the er absorption to contribute about 6.5 db/cm to the cavity loss at the wavelength of at 1.54 μm. the tm-like mode, on the other hand, extends far out of the disk, resulting in a modeoverlap of 0.50 ±0.02, and a radiation limited theoretical q-factor of only 80,000.4

loss of the tm-like mode the actual q-factors of the fabricated microdisks were measured using a u-bent tapered ﬁber [ 82] mounted on a three-axis translator with sub-nm resolution. the diameter of the tapered section was measured to be 1.36 μm. due to the strong electrostatic force between the ﬁber and the disk, all measurements were performed with the ﬁber directly in contact with the disk edge. light from a tunable laser(1,475–1,545 nm) with a linewidth <300 khz and controlled polarization was then coupled into the tapered ﬁber. resonance modes of the microdisk were investigated by measuring the change in the transmitted beam intensity as the signal wavelengthwas swept. the details of the measurement setup are shown in [ 83]. figure 4.28 shows a ccd camera image of the disk in contact with the tapered ﬁber. the u-bent ﬁber is essentially straight at this scale, and is resting on the top edge of the disk. also shown are the transmission spectra for te- and tm- polarized input signals. we obtain clear dips in the transmitted signal intensity. inparticular, we obtain major dips occurring in pairs near 1,490, 1,505, and 1,520 nm, corresponding to a free spectral range of 14.4 nm. this corresponds to a modal index and effective resonator diameter of 1.98 and 25.3 μm, respectively, in excel- lent agreement with the data presented above. furthermore, the position of these transmission dips agree very well with the expected positions of the ﬁrst- and second-order radial te-like modes, calculated by fdtd simulations (indicated122 j.s. chang et al. fig. 4.28 the transmission spectra for tm- and te-polarized input light, together with the expected position for ﬁrst-order radial modes for te-like modes. shown in the inset is the optical microscope image of the srsn:er microdisk in contact with the coupling ﬁber by short vertical lines). thus, we identify them to be the ﬁrst- and second-order whispering gallery modes. the remaining transmission dips are ascribed to behigher order radial modes. the measured q-factors of the ﬁrst-order te-like modes, obtained by dividing the resonance wavelength by the transmission dip width, are ∼5,000 and ∼8,900 for the disks with 0.2 and 0.02 at.% er, respectively. for the higher order te-like modes, the q-factor can be as high as 13,000. for the tm-like mode, however, the q-factors are much lower, being around 1,000 only. these q-factors are comparable to those reported previously from sin micro- ring resonators [ 84], but much lower than the intrinsic q-factors estimated by fdtd. surface and edge scattering and absorption by er cannot be the reason for such low values, as it can induce a loss of at most 10 db/cm, corresponding to aq-factor of 46,900 for the te-like mode. on the other hand, the microdisk cavity is coupled very strongly to the ﬁber due to the direct contact of the ﬁber with the disk. furthermore, the fact that the weakly coupled higher-order modes consistently showa much higher q-factor suggests that the coupling ﬁber itself is a signiﬁcant source of the loss. therefore, we have extracted the ﬁber-induced loss using the coupled mode theory [ 85,86]. as shown in fig. 4.29, the theory considers the loss due to the coupling with the ﬁber in ﬁtting the lorentzian dip in the transmission spectrum.4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 123 fig. 4.29 terms considered in coupled mode theory for extracting the cavity q-factor from mea- sured transmission spectra since the coupling ﬁber is very thin, we neglect the higher order mode of the ﬁber, in which case we can describe the lorentzian dip by fwhm =1/τcavity+1/τ0 ﬁber lorenztian dip =(1−s·loss)×{ 1−( 1/τcavity−1/τ0 ﬁber)2 ( 1/τcavity+1/τ0 ﬁber)2} (4.4) where 1 /τcavity represents the entire cavity loss (including scattering, absorption, and radiation), 1 /τﬁberrepresents the ﬁber coupling loss, and s ·loss represents the loss of the input power at the ﬁber-cavity contact. figure 4.30 shows a detailed ﬁt to a transmission dip due to a ﬁrst-order radial mode of the microdisk, and the results of the ﬁts. we ﬁnd that te-like modes cou-pling with the ﬁber dominate the overall loss. the intrinsic cavity q-factor for the ﬁrst-order radial modes can be as large as 26,580. since this contains the er absorp- tion loss, the intrinsic q factor of the resonator structure itself is much higher, and is estimated to be 4 .5×10 4. this corresponds to a loss of about 9 db/cm, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the calculated values. for the tm-like modes, on theother hand, the q-factor is dominated by the intrinsic cavity q-factor, which can be as low as 2,100, corresponding to a very large cavity loss of >180 db/cm that is several orders of magnitude larger than the calculated values. in order to investigate the origin of the large cavity losses, we have performed fdtd simulations that included the coupling ﬁber. the results of the simulation, together with the structure used in the simulation, are shown in fig. 4.31.a ss h o w n in fig. 4.31b, we ﬁnd that with the ﬁber in contact with the disk the te-like mode excited in the disk decays exponentially with a decay time of 0.02 ns, corresponding to a q-factor of only 26,520 even though no scattering or absorption losses wereincluded, indicating the coupling with the ﬁber is a major source of optical loss for the microcavity. in addition, as fig. 4.31c shows, the shape of the h zﬁeld is no124 j.s. chang et al. re 0.2 at.%  te-like q0 fiber qcavity qcavity without er

was excited, indicating that the ﬁber induces a cavity loss of the ﬁrst-order te-like mode via coupling with higher-order modes as well. on the other hand, as figs. 4.31d and e show, the values of|hz|2and|h|2are identical, indicating that the overall mode remains te-like. with the ﬁber in contact with the disk, the tm-like mode decays even more rapidly with a decay time of 3.75 ps, corresponding to a q-factor of 5,560, as shown in fig. 4.31f. this is partly due to the large mode overlap of the tm mode with the ﬁber that results in a stronger coupling with the ﬁber, as indicated by the large light intensity in the ﬁber shown in fig. 4.31g. another important reason for such low q-factor is shown in figs. 4.31h and i. we ﬁnd that the value of |hz|2, which corresponds to the te-like component, is within 99.5% of the total |h|2, indicating that the overall steady-state mode is te-like even though the disk was excited via a tm-polarized source within the disk. this indicates that the contact with the ﬁber4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 125 fig. 4.31 (a) the structure used in calculations that include the

(b) a low excitation efﬁciency of the wgm (pump light not absorbed within the mode volume does not lead to excitation of thewgm); and (c) an intrinsically low quantum efﬁciency (a 2.62 ev photon is used to obtain an 0.8 ev photon). furthermore, increasing the absorption while main- taining uniform excitation is difﬁcult. also, shaping the top-pumping beam into a4 er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitrides and er silicates for on-chip light sources 127 well-aligned annulus is non-trivial [ 88]. in other words, while nc-si sensitization plus top-pumping offer advantages in terms of cost and robust pumping, it alsointroduces factors that can substantially lower the overall efﬁciency of the ﬁnal device even under the best conditions, and this should be taken into account when developing this technology into a practical application. 4.5 conclusion in conclusion, we have introduced er-doped silicon-rich silicon nitride (srsn:er)and er silicates as novel materials that can provide high and stable er concentra-tions and a high refractive index for compact on-chip light sources. srsn:er allows sensitization of er by nc-si without optical de-activation of er, and er silicates can provide gain in excess of 30 db/cm, while at the same time providing a much sup-pressed cooperative upconversion. the actual realization of light sources using these materials still needs more research, but as the work on srsn:er demonstrates, many promising on-chip photonic devices can already be realized with them. acknowledgments this work was supported in part by grant no.

age. ge on si nucle- ates si photonics as well as high-speed cmos electronics. recently, ge has played a signiﬁcant role in integrating materials such as iii–vs on si. the structure ofgaas on a thick ge layer on si has been studied for many years to expand its device application menu such as lasers, high-performance transistors, and tandem solar cells on si. however, an ultra-thin ge buffer layer (referred to as (ge) hereafter)technology described in this chapter has created new ﬁelds for applications. one of the emerging ﬁelds is the structure and properties of algaas/gaas/(ge)/si/ge, which has been impossible to create previously using the thick ge buffer on sitechnology. here, we demonstrate an application as a new green power generation platform, i.e., high-efﬁciency cost-effective tandem solar cells using si as a cell as well as the mechanical substrate. the (ge) thickness has not been fully optimizedyet, but is in the range 10–20 nm. our design for a tandem solar cell shows that its theoretical efﬁciency reaches 43%. the key attributes are the crystalline quality and surface roughness of ultrathin (ge). we have experimentally optimized the (ge)buffer thickness to achieve both requirements and prototyped ge solar cells on si. the ge solar cells have successfully reproduced their ideal external quantum efﬁ- ciency. this is the proof of concept of the success of the ge challenge as the materialenabler to integrate si and gaas. 5.1 introduction germanium has nucleated solid-state electronics as a material for transistors [ 1], and has now empowered current electronics as a stressor of si complementary metal oxide semiconductor (cmos) circuits [ 2]. it is considered that ge will be a material r. ichikawa, s. takita, and y . ishikawa ( b) department of

5], and even an optical gain media in the optical communication wavelength range [ 6]. thus, ge has been regarded as a material enabler to converge electronics and photonics on the si cmos platform, i.e., si photonics. in the current stage ofsi photonics development, such an ultrathin layer of ge, hereafter referred to as (ge), can perform as an excellent buffer layer between ge and si, i.e., highly lattice mismatched material systems. the natural consequence of the (ge) technology isto combine heterogeneous materials such as gaas on si, since ge perfectly lattice- matches with gaas-based devices that can be light emitters, high-speed transistors, and solar cells. in this chapter, we will explore another challenge of (ge) as a mate-rial integration platform of si and gaas, which can be referred to as a “green power generation platform.” we design a four-junction algaas(1)/algaas(2)/(ge)/si/ge tandem solar cell, that could not be done previously without the ultrathin (ge)technology. we present the theoretical design of the tandem cells, the experimental results of the (ge) buffer layer optimization, and a prototype ge/si solar cell as a proof of concept. 5.2 material design ge is an element that lies between ga and as in the periodic table, and thus there aremany similarities in the physical and chemical properties of ge and gaas. typical examples are the lattice constant, linear expansion coefﬁcient, and thermal conduc- tivity, as given in table 5.1[7]. these similarities favor hetero-epitaxial growth of gaas on ge or vice versa. despite the fact that ge is a non-polar material while gaas is a polar material, anti-phase domain boundaries (apds) of gaas on ge have naturally been suppressed by introducing a miss-orientation of the sub-strate surface orientation. high-quality gaas epilayers on ge bulk substrates and its hetero-structures have been achieved [ 8]. on the other hand, ge is limited in natural abundance and in technological matu- rity, compared with si where 30-cm-diameter dislocation-free wafers are commer- cially available. thus, the ﬁrst material integration was attempted for gaas on si. as calculated from table 5.1, the lattice mismatch between gaas and si is as large as 4%, which naturally lead to a high density of dislocations in gaas on si [ 9]. these defects have made the material integration of si and gaas unsuccessful. on the other hand, it has recently been reported that dislocation-free ge mesas can be grown on si [ 1]. in this method a (ge) buffer layer was ﬁrst grown on si at a table 5.1 material parameters of ge, gaas, and si at 300 k materialslattice constants (nm)linear expansion coefﬁcient (10−6/◦c)thermal conductivity (w/cm/◦c) bandgap (ev) ge 0.5658 5.9 0.58 0.661gaas 0.565325 5.73 0.55 1.424si 0.5431 2.6 1.3 1.125 germanium as a material to enable silicon photonics 133 low temperature (around 300–400◦c) and a ge epilayer was then grown on it at a medium temperature (around 600◦c), hereafter referred to as two-step growth. the (ge) buffer layer is highly dislocated but the subsequently grown ge epilayers con- tain a reduced density of threading dislocations, i.e., ∼109cm−3. such a high den- sity of threading dislocations was reduced during a high temperature post-growthannealing. the mechanism should be a strain-driven dislocation glide and reaction: ge has a linear expansion coefﬁcient twice that of si, as indicated in table 5.1, inducing thermal mismatch during the post-growth annealing. threading disloca-tions in the ge epilayer become mobile in terms of stress generated in the ge layer annealed at high and low temperatures cyclically. in other words, heating the ge epilayers on si substrates to a higher temperature near the melting point introducescompressive strain within the ge epilayer. the strain mobilizes threading disloca- tions, gliding the dislocations to relax in the epilayer. cooling the structure down to a lower temperature around 700 ◦c where threading dislocations are still mobile in ge introduces tensile strain in the ge epilayer that also glides back dislocations to relax in the epilayer. these motions of threading dislocations eventually reduce the dislocation density in terms of dislocation annihilation in pairs with opposite burgers vectors. when the ge epilayers are smaller than the gliding distance for dislocations, dislocation-free ge epilayers on si should be obtained [ 1]. in addition, ge never grows on silica masks in terms of the reduction reaction of silica by ge, resulting in ge on si patterns with no islands on silica patterns. currently, square ge mesas of 10 ×10μm2have been reported dislocation-free even on si. this suggests that the dislocation glide distance would be about 5 μm. larger mesas can be dislocation-free, when the larger stress is accumulated in the mesas in terms of rapid thermal processing. these experiments are strongly suggestive that dislocation-free gaas on (ge) on si should be possible provided that the ge on si is dislocation-free. algaas is a lattice matching system of gaas, and indeed dislocation-free on gaas. thus,algaas/gaas hetero-structures should be possible on si using the (ge) buffer and mesa technology. since threading dislocations in gaas and algaas systems act as efﬁcient recombination centers to degrade device performance, the dislocation-freege on si would be a new material integration platform to integrate si with gaas. the material integration would enable electronic and photonic convergence on the si cmos platform. si has a twice larger thermal conductivity (see table 5.1), acting as an excellent heat sink as well for the high injection devices if realized on si. actually, such material integration has been performed to demonstrate lasers andlight emitting diodes on si [ 10]. it required thick (ge) buffer layers to grow gaas on si and is difﬁcult to apply to tandem solar cell stacks. we will come back this point later on. 5.3 device design: tandem cells highly efﬁcient, series-connected tandem solar cells using ge and iii–v compoundssuch as gaas/ge, ingap/ingaas/ge, and ingap/gaas/ge have attracted muchattention due to their lattice matching characteristics [ 11]. however, it was quite134 r. ichikawa et al. challenging to achieve four-junction tandem solar cells with the materials system of interest: ge and gaas. it is because of the current mismatch due to the large differ-ence in the bandgap energy (e g)between gaas (1.424 ev) and ge (0.661 ev), as shown in table 5.1. recently, gainnas has attained technological interest because of the following reasons: ﬁrst, the bandgap can be controlled to be ∼1 ev at the mid- dle of gaas and ge enabling current matching, and second, the lattice constant can be matched to ge and gaas. indeed, the four-junction gainp/gaas/gainnas/ge tandem solar cell has been prototyped [ 12]. however, there is still the challenging issue associated with ge substrates, i.e., low thermal conductivity (see table 5.1). its technical immaturity is always the issue. si is an ideal material to breakthrough these issues and to meet the bandgap requirement of ∼1 ev , as indicated in table 5.1, provided that the lattice mismatch issue is solved. we have designed a four-junction tandem solar cell using si highlighting a middle bandgap material and a substrate with technical maturity. in other words,the four tandem cell structure can basically be algaas/gaas/(ge)/si/ge and gainp/gaas/(ge)/si/ge. we have chosen the former cell structure to design the structure and the layer thicknesses together with the alloy content of the algaas layer on a quantitative basis. this tandem solar cell was designed, focusing on the current matching by calculating the photocurrent generation at each thickness, usingthe following equation [ 13]. j sc=∫ φ(λ)×(1−exp[−α(λ)×l])dλ, (5.1) where jscdenotes the short-circuit current density (ma/cm2),φ(λ) is the number of incident photons of am1.5g (/nm) [ 14],α(λ) is the optical absorption coefﬁcient (/cm), and lis the thicknesses of the cells (cm). for simplicity, we assumed the following: (a) the ideal current collection conditions of all the layers, i.e., external quantum efﬁciency (eqe) =1. (b) light passes through each cell once with internal reﬂections ignored. the absorption coefﬁcients of gaas and algaas employed are taken from [ 15] and [ 16]. it turned out that the gaas layer should be an al-lean algaas layer for perfect current matching. figure 5.1shows the structure of a tandem solar cell al xga1−xas/al yga1−yas/si/ ge with a ge buffer layer on si, which meets the current matching requirement. as in fig. 5.2, the photocurrent accumulated from 300 to 1,550 nm is 54.05 ma, assum- ing the am1.5g current spectrum (100 mw/cm2, 1 sun). the dotted and dashed lines are referred to as the current division by four cells and the ge buffer layer, respectively. the bottom cell is ge and its bandgap (eg,ge direct )is 0.80 ev . the reason for using the direct gap here is our assumption that the ge layer is thin, because of epitaxial growth. ge generates 54.05 ma when it absorbs light shorter than 1,550 nm (0.8 ev) in wavelength. however, the weak ge absorption near the5 germanium as a material to enable silicon photonics 135 fig. 5.1 schematic of the alxga1−xas/alyga1−yas/si/ge tandem solar cell fig. 5.2 the am1.5g current spectrum division inthe tandem cell of fig. 5.1 band edge generates a slightly lower current. for example, it is 53.3 ma/cm2instead when the ge epilayer is 3 μm thick. therefore, jscof each cell is about 13 ma/cm2, as in fig. 5.2. here, we ignored the absorption by the (ge) layer, which does not alter the ﬁnal thickness determination, as described next. the (ge) buffer accumulates most defects in the layer, especially in the vicinity of the si and (ge) interface, allowing a nearly perfect subsequent al yga1−yas layer to grow on it. however, the ge buffer layer should act as an absorber causing light loss. this is because photo-excited charges generated in ge buffer layer may easilyrecombine through defects in the layer and do not contribute to the short-circuit current. this loss of photocurrent reduces the total j scin terms of the lower pho- tocurrents in the lower-positioned si and ge cells. the photocurrent calculated tobe generated in the (ge) buffer layer is shown in fig. 5.3. here, we assumed that the top and second-to-top cells are al 0.30ga0.70as (223 nm thick) and al 0.05ga0.95as (878 nm thick), respectively. although the photocurrent generated in the (ge) bufferlayer increases with the (ge) buffer layer thickness, the photocurrent loss is below 2 ma/cm 2when the (ge) buffer thickness is a typical one, i.e., 10–30 nm in the growth of ge on si. thus, the (ge) layer can be neglected in the calculation ofthe photocurrents for current matching. nonetheless, we have rigorously counted its loss effect in the design of our tandem structures. figure 5.4shows the thick- ness of the si and ge cells as a function of the thickness of the (ge) buffer layer.136 r. ichikawa et al. fig. 5.3 photocurrent generated by the ge bufferlayer as a function of thethickness of the ge bufferlayer below al

cells are al 0.30ga0.70as and al 0.05ga0.95as, respectively. it is clear that the si and ge cells should thicken with the (ge) buffer layer. one of the material setproperties is that the si layer should be 101–307 μm thick when the (ge) buffer layer is ∼15 nm thick, generating j sc=12–13 ma /cm2in the si cell. since si solar cells are currently around 200 μm thick, the si wafer can be used as both a substrate and one of tandem cells as previously noted. furthermore, the ge layer should be 1.168–2.580 μm thick when the (ge) buffer layer is again ∼15 nm thick. this material set property is also realistic according to our experience. the ge cellgenerates j sc=12–13 ma /cm2when meeting the current matching condition. the ﬁnal issue is to design the composition and thickness of the upper algaas cells on the (ge) buffer to get a jscof 12–13 ma/cm2. figure 5.5shows the thick- ness of these algaas cells as a function of the short-circuit current density of 12–13 ma/cm2. the variable parameter is the al composition x and y. figure 5.5a is for the top cell, and fig. 5.5b is for the second cell when the top cell is5 germanium as a material to enable silicon photonics 137 fig. 5.5

al0.30ga0.70as. to achieve a high open-circuit voltage, the al composition should be high. it is found from fig. 5.5a that the top cell’s thickness should increase with al composition because the al rich algaas causes a blue-shift of the optical absorption edge. however, the high al composition (x>0.3)algaas frequently results in al oxidation, which could generate unwanted recombination centers and lead to current mismatch between the cells. to compromise on the above mentionedissues, we have chosen al 0.30ga0.70as as the top cell. for a high short-circuit cur- rent density, the al yga1−yas cell must be thick, but it is better to keep the thickness under about 1 μm when considering a practical epitaxial growth time. these consid- erations determine that the best composition for the second cell is al 0.05ga0.95as. 5.4 materials and device characteristics: (ge) buffer on si and ge solar cell on si the quality of the (ge) buffer layer is the key to realize this tandem cell, because al1−ygayas growth on ge and al 1−xgaxas growth on al 1−ygayas are thus pos- sible. to obtain a high-quality algaas layer, the surface roughness of ge buffer layer should be low. we implemented the ge growth experiment on a non-vicinal p−si (100) wafer at 370◦c without annealing using ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (uhv – cvd). the (ge) buffer layer thicknesses were 15, 30, and 60 nm. figure 5.6shows the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the ge surface measured by atomic force microscopy (afm) as a function of the ge thickness. itis clear that the rms roughness increases with the (ge) buffer thickness. figure 5.7 shows the full width at a half maximum (fwhm) of the (ge) buffer peak in x-ray diffraction (xrd) measurement as a function of the ge thickness. the fwhm138 r.

on the variation of the ge lattice, which reﬂects its crystalline quality. the fwhm decreases with the (ge) buffer thickness, indicating that bettercrystalline quality is obtained with the thicker (ge) buffer. to decide the optimum thickness, we have deﬁned the ﬁgure of merit (fom) as a qualitative measure: fom=1 rms·fwhm ·absorption. (5.2) here, the absorption is a measure of the photocurrent generated by the (ge) buffer layer. the rms roughness, crystalline quality (fwhm), and light loss are shownin figs. 5.6,5.7, and 5.3, respectively. figure 5.8shows the fom as a function of the thickness of the (ge) buffer layer. from consideration of the fom, a thin (ge) buffer layer 15 nm thick is optimal, as shown in this experiment. to check the abovementioned buffer layer technology, we have fabricated the ge solar cells on a si substrate and measured the efﬁciency of ge solar cells on si. the solar cell structure from the top down is the following: 50-nm si cap/1- μm ge with 15 nm (ge) buffer layer/p +si substrate. the growth temperatures of the (ge) buffer and upper ge epilayer were 370 and 600◦c, respectively. after epitaxial growth, phosphorous ions were implanted at 70 kev at a dose of 6 ×1014cm−2into the5 germanium as a material to enable silicon photonics 139 fig. 5.8 figure of merit (fom

lines are the eqe of the solar cell and of atheoretical calculation assuming 1 μm ge as an active layer, respectively. it is clear that the experimental data have been reproduced by the theory. the red-shift of the experiment compared with the theoretical calculation is the bandgap shrinkage in terms of the tensile strain induced by thermal mismatch between the si and ge expansion coefﬁcients [ 17]. table 5.2summarizes the optimum thickness of each cell at j sc=13 ma /cm2 considering the experiment noted above. the top al 0.30ga0.70as cell is 223 nm thick, which ﬁts with a short growth time and allows the formation of a thin p+ and n+layer at the top and bottom subsurface layer. the second al 0.05ga0.95as cell is suitable for a reasonable growth time. the thickness of the si and ge cells are also appropriate as a wafer and for epitaxial growth, respectively. table 5.2 the optimum thickness of each cell for thetandem solar cell at j sc=13 ma/cm2layer thickness (μm) al0.3ga0.7as 0.223

factors (ff) have been derived assuming that the ideality factor of the pn diodes would be 1 and voc=eg−0.4. here eg= 1.798 ev for al 0.30ga0.70as,eg=1.486 ev for al 0.05ga0.95as,eg=1.12 ev for si, and eg=0.8 ev for ge. a very high-power efﬁciency should be obtained by the present tandem solar cell using a si wafer. 5.5 summary we have described the use of ge as a material enabler for si photonics, especiallyfor green power generation technology based on si. the role of ge as a materi-als integration platform of gaas with si and the newly developed ultrathin (ge) buffer layer play an essential part in this solar cell application. we have designed four-junction tandem cells of the type al xga1−xas/al yga1−yas/(ge)/si/ge, as described in table 5.2. here, si acts as a solar cell with eg=1.12 ev and as a substrate with the required mechanical strength. a theoretical calculation indicatesthe cell efﬁciency to be 43% under am1.5g and 1-sun conditions. this should be equivalent to the tandem cell of a gainnas cell on ge instead of the si cell. the ge solar cell fabricated on si has reproduced the theoretically predicted external quan-tum efﬁciency, which overcomes the potential weak point of the tandem structure induced by the (ge) buffer layer. this gives us clear evidence that ge should be an enabler of materials integration of gaas with si. the materials integration based on ge will stimulate gaas-based photonic and electronic devices as well. as shown in table 5.1, the thermal conductivity of si is twice as high as that of ge and gaas, which should be another beneﬁt from the useof si. in other words, the heat penalty is always the factor limiting the performance and reliability of high injection devices such as lasers and high electron mobility transistors (hemts). acknowledgments the basic concept was created at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) and submitted as the mit case number 10445 while one of the authors (kw) was at themit

how to manage and integrate enormously complexdesigns that combine the richest imaginable mix of microprocessors, memories, busses, architectures, communications standards, protocol processors, interfaces, and other intellectual property components where system level considerations ofsynchronization, testability, conformance, and veriﬁcation are crucial. integrated circuit (ic) design has become a multi-million-gate challenge for which only the best design teams are good enough.6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 145 the techniques used in designing multi-million-gate socs employ the world’s most advanced electronic design automation (eda), with a level of sophisticationthat requires highly trained and experienced engineers. key issues to be managed in the design process include achieving timing closure that accounts for wire delays in the metal interconnects inside the chip, and designs for tests so that the chips can bemanufactured economically. early prediction of the right architecture, design-ﬂow, and best use of eda solutions is required to achieve the ﬁrst silicon success that can decrease the time-to-market from years to months. the building-blocks of a soc can be distinguished in initiators, or processing elements (pes) and targets, or storage elements (ses); initiators are all the blocks able to generate trafﬁc, i.e., write data into a se and read data from a se; targets are blocks able to manage the trafﬁc generated by the initiators. among the initiators of the system the following classes can be identiﬁed: •processors; •real time initiators; •dmas (direct memory access). processors , like st20, st40, st50, and lx from stmicroelectronics, have strict requirements in terms of latency and bandwidth. anyways, their bandwidth must be in some way limited to allow the other initiators to be serviced. real time initiators , like audio/video blocks, are more latency tolerant than the processors, but have strict needs in terms of bandwidth. dmas do not have any particular requirements in terms of latency or bandwidth, and normally they can work using the remaining bandwidth, that is the part of the bandwidth not consumed by the processors and the real time initiators. among the targets the following classes can be identiﬁed: •external fast memories; •internal slow memories; •peripherals. external fast memories comprise high performance memories such as sdram (synchronous dynamic random access memory) and ddr (dual data rate) sdram, used mainly for real time applications like video, and today working at around400 mhz. their speed is limited by physical constraints imposed by pads. slow memories are usually low performance memories like sram and flash, used for storage of huge amounts of data, whose access is managed by caches,working at around 200 mhz. their speed is limited by application reasons. peripherals are slow memories such as i 2c and smartcard, used where no high performances are required, and working at around 50/100 mhz. normally the cpus run at the highest speed and the memory system represents the soc bottleneck in terms of performance. the different clock frequencies required to operate the different subsystems are generated by the clockgen, i.e., the clock generator; this approach consisting of hav- ing within a chip different islands running at different frequencies is called gals (globally asynchronous locally synchronous) and is widely used today.146 a. scandurra fig. 6.1 soc typical organization on-chip communication systemexternal  fast memories initiators(processors,real timeblocks, dmas)    slow memories peripherals the different subsystems working at different frequencies are linked together by the on-chip interconnect (fig. 6.1), such as the stbus/stnoc [ 1] in the case of stmicroelectronics products. typically the on-chip interconnect optimizes the cpu path; that is the intercon- nect normally works at the same frequency as the cpu. proper frequency converters have to be placed between the interconnect and the other subsystems to perform the required frequency conversion in order to make thedifferent subsystems communicate with each other. 6.3 on-chip communication from a communication point of view, a typical soc can be seen as a number of pro-cessing elements and storage elements connected by proper communication archi- tectures. as shown in fig. 6.2, a central and key element in a complex soc is the global on-chip communication architecture (occa), the infrastructure that inter- connects these devices and provides the communication mechanisms necessary for distributed computation among different processing elements. the throughput and fig. 6.2 generic soc architecture6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 147 latency of the communication infrastructure, and also the relevant power consump- tion, often limit the overall soc performance. till now the prominent type of occa has been the on-chip bus, such the stbus from stmicroelectronics, the amba bus from arm, coreconnect from ibm or siliconbackplane from sonics, which represent the traditional shared-communication medium; such an occa, not scalable at all, has been able to fulﬁll soc requirements because the performance bottleneck has always been the memory system. with the growing requirements of more modern socs and cmos technology scaling, the performance bottleneck is moving from memories to interconnect, as detailed in sect. 6.4. to overcome this limit, a new generation architecture, called network on chip (noc), has been deeply studied and proposed; it is an attempt to translate the networking and parallel computing domain experience into the soc world, relyingon a packet-switched micro-network backbone based on a well-deﬁned protocol stack. innovative noc architectures include vstnoc from stmicroelectronics, æthereal (philips research lab), and xpipe (university of bologna). 6.3.1 on-chip bus on-chip busses are communication systems composed of an intelligent logic,responsible for arbitration among the possible trafﬁc ﬂows injected by the different soc initiators (pes able to generate trafﬁc), and a set of physical channels through which the trafﬁc ﬂows are routed from initiators to targets (pes able to receive andprocess trafﬁc) and vice versa. the peculiarities of a bus, which are also the main drawbacks, are •limited available bandwidth, given by the product of the bus size by the bus operating frequency; getting a higher available bandwidth would result in widen- ing the bus size, thereby amplifying physical issues such as wire congestion, orincreasing the operation frequency, having an impact on the power consumption, and in turn limited by physical issues such as capacitive load and capacitive cou- pling; •lack of bandwidth scalability, since connecting more ips to the bus means to divide the total available bandwidth among all the ips, thereby allocating to each of them a lower bandwidth; •limited system scalability, since connecting more ips to the bus results in an increase of the capacitive load, responsible for an operating frequency drop; •limited quality of service, since there is no possibility to treat in a different way different trafﬁc classes, such as low latency cpus, high bandwidth demanding video/audio processors, and dmas; •high area occupancy, due to the high number of wires required to transport all the protocol information, i.e., data and control signals (stbus interfaces, for example, are characterized by hundreds of wires); •high power consumption, determined by the switching activity potentially affect- ing all the wires of the bus.148 a. scandurra 6.3.2 network on chip as already mentioned, to overcome the disadvantages of on-chip busses, both the classic shared-bus (like amba ahb) and the more advanced communication sys- tems supporting crossbar structures (such as the stbus) used in current socs, high-lighted by the new requirement and needs of modern applications in conjunction with the most recent technology features, a novel on-chip communication architec- ture called noc has been proposed. it is important to highlight that the noc concept is not a mere adaptation to the soc context of the parallel computing or the wide area network domains; many issues are in fact still open in this new ﬁeld, and the highly complex design spacerequires a deep exploration. key open points are, for instance, the choice of the net- work topology, the message format, the end-to-end services, the routing strategies, the ﬂow control and the queuing management. moreover which kind of quality ofservice (qos) to provide is another open issue, as well the most suitable software view for allowing the applications to exploit the noc infrastructure peculiarities. exploiting the lesson learned by the telecommunication community, the global on-chip communication is decomposed into layers similar to the iso-osi refer- ence model (see fig. 6.3). the protocol stack enables different services and allows qos, providing to the programmer an abstraction of the communication framework. layers interact through well-deﬁned interfaces and they hide the low-level physical dsm (deep submicron) issues. the physical layer refers to all that concerns the electronic details of wires, the circuits and techniques to drive information (drivers, repeaters, layout); data link ensures a reliable transfer despite the physical unreliability and deals with mediumaccess (sharing/contention). at the network level there are issues related to the topology and the consequent routing scheme, while the transport layer manages the end-to-end services and the packet segmentation/re-assembly. the other levels,up to the application layer, can be viewed as a sort of merged adaptation layer that implements (in hw or through part of an os) services and exposes the noc infrastructure according to a proper programming model, e.g., the message passing(mp) paradigm. fig. 6.3 iso-osi protocol stack6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 149 despite the similarity discussed above, it is clear that the micro-network in the single chip domain differs from the wide-area network; noc unique features arethe spatial locality of connected modules, the reduced non-determinism of the on- chip trafﬁc, the energy and latency constraints, the possibility of application speciﬁc stack services, and the need for low cost solutions. an open issue in the noc literature is the trade-off between the qos provided by the network and the relevant implementation cost; on the other hand, a best effort service allows for a better average utilization but it cannot support a qos. usersdemand predictability of the application, so to mix both approaches could be a smart solution. some papers provided an exhaustive overview of a qos approach. qos must be supported at all layers, and basic services are a ﬁxed bandwidth, a maximumlatency, and the correctness (no errors) and the completion (no packet loss) of the transmission. the noc communication is packet-based and the generally accepted forwarding scheme is a wormhole because it allows for a deeper pipeline and a reduced buffer- ing cost. packets are divided into basic units called ﬂits; the queues in each node have the ﬂit granularity and the physical node-to-node links are managed by a ﬂow control that works on a ﬂit per ﬂit basis. another key point is the network topology, which has to be regular and simple. literature foresees hybrid solutions with the local cluster based on shared buses and noc for global communication. some noc state-of-the-art projects are based on the simple ring, two-dimensional mesh, fat tree [ 2], and octagon [ 3] topologies, as shown in fig. 6.4. as far as the routing policy is concerned, it is possible to choose between deterministic, adaptive, source, arithmetic, or table-driven schemes; the dead-lock handling is topology dependent. input queues are suitable for a low cost implementation, but they show limited performance with respect to output buffering. in terms of control ﬂow many solutions select a simple request/grant scheme, othersa more efﬁcient credit-based one. links can be noise channels, so the literature begins to present work on error detection code or error correction code applied to on-chip interconnections, with distributed or end-to-end error recovery strategies. fig. 6.4 different noc topologies150 a. scandurra besides routers, a signiﬁcant amount of area is consumed by the so-called net- work interface (ni) that is the “access” to the noc, translating the connected iptransactions to packets that are exchanged in the network. the ni hides network- dependent aspects to the pe, covering the transport layer (connection handling, de-assembling of messages, higher level services). to summarize, here is a list of the main beneﬁts of the noc approach: •modularity, thanks to standard basic components, the ni, and the router; •abstraction as an inherent property of the layered approach, ﬁtting also the demands of qos; •ﬂexibility/scalability of the network as a beneﬁt of a packet-based communica- tion; •regular and well-controlled structure to cope with dsm issues; •re-use of the communication infrastructure viewed as a platform. 6.3.2.1 topology two different approaches can be followed for the speciﬁcation of the topology of a noc: •topology dependent •topology independent the former approach speciﬁes the network architecture and its building blocks assuming a well-deﬁned topology. the latter one aims at providing ﬂexibility to the soc architect in choosing the topology for the interconnect, depending on the application. this means that it is possible to build any kind of topology by plug- ging together the noc building-blocks in the proper way. even though it is moreversatile because of the higher conﬁgurability allowed, this second approach has the following drawbacks: •a very wide design and veriﬁcation space, which would require a very big effort to ensure to the noc user a high-quality product; •the complexity of the network layer design (including issues such as deadlock) would be exposed to the soc architect, thus requiring novel speciﬁc compe-tencies and high effort in deﬁning an effective (in terms of performance) and deadlock-free architecture; •the need of high parametric building blocks, with few cost optimization possibil- ities. moreover the noc built on top of a speciﬁc topology still presents a high degree of ﬂexibility (routing, ﬂow control, queues, qos) in order to properly conﬁgure theinterconnect for supporting different application requirements. a topology is said to be scalable if it is possible to create larger networks of any size, by simply adding new nodes.6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 151 6.3.2.2 routing algorithms routing algorithms are responsible for the selection of a path from a source node to a destination node in a particular topology of a network. a good routing algorithm balances the load across the various network channels even in the presence of non-uniform and heavy trafﬁc patterns. a well-designed routing algorithm also keeps path lengths as short as possible, reducing then the overall latency of a message. another important aspect of a routing algorithm is its ability to work in the pres- ence of faults in the network. if a particular algorithm is hardwired into the routers and a link or node fails, the entire network fails. if the algorithm can instead bereprogrammed or adapted to bypass the failure, the system can continue to operate with only a slight loss in performance. routing algorithms are classiﬁed depending on how they select between the pos- sible paths from a source node to a destination node. three main categories are speciﬁed: •deterministic, where always the same path is chosen between a source and a destination node, even if multiple paths exist; •oblivious, where the path is chosen without taking into account the present state of the network; oblivious routing algorithms include deterministic routing algo- rithms as a subset; •adaptive, where the current state of the network is used to select the path. 6.3.2.3 deadlock a deadlock is the condition occurring in an interconnection network when a set of packets are unable to make any progress because they are waiting for one another to release network resources, such as buffers or channels. deadlock is a catastrophic event for the network. after a few resources are kept busy by deadlocked packets, other packets get blocked on these resources, thus par- alyzing the network operation. to prevent such a problem, two solutions can be putin place: •deadlock avoidance, a method to guarantee that the network cannot become dead- locked; •deadlock recovery, a method consisting of detecting and correcting deadlock. if deadlock is caused by dependencies external to the network, it is called high level deadlock or protocol deadlock (hereafter we call low-level deadlock the one related to the dependencies of the topology plus the relevant routing algorithm).for instance a simple request/response protocol could lead to deadlock conditions when dependencies occur in target devices between the incoming requests and the outgoing responses. a network must always be free of deadlock, livelock, and starvation. a livelock refers to packets circulating the network without making any progress toward their destination. starvation refers to packets indeﬁnitely waiting at a network buffer (due152 a. scandurra to an unfair queuing policy). both livelock and starvation reﬂect problems of fair- ness in network routing or scheduling policies. as far as deadlock is concerned, in the case of deterministic routing, dead- lock is avoided by eliminating cycles in the resource dependency graph; this is a directed graph, which depends on the topology and the routing, where the ver-tices are the resources and the edges represent the relationships due to the routing function. in the case of wormhole packet switching, these resources are the virtual channels; so we talk about a virtual channel dependency graph. a virtual channel(vc) provides logical links over the same shared physical channels, by establish- ing a number of independently allocated ﬂit buffers in the corresponding trans- mitter/receiver nodes. when the physical link is not multiplexed among differentvcs, the resource dependency graph could be simply called a channel dependency graph. the protocol (or high level) deadlock refers to a deadlock condition due to resource dependencies external to the network. for instance, when a request- response protocol, such as stbus from stmicroelectronics or amba axi from arm, is adopted as end-to-end in the network, a node connected as target introduces dependencies between incoming requests and outgoing responses: the node does not perform as a sink for incoming packets, due to the ﬁnite size of the buffers and thedependencies between requests and responses. in shared memory architectures, complex cache-coherent protocols could lead to a deeper level of dependencies. the effect of these protocol dependencies can beeliminated by using disjoint networks to handle requests and replies; the following two approaches are possible: •two physical networks, i.e., separated physical data buses for requests and responses; •two virtual networks, i.e., separated virtual channels for requests and responses. 6.3.2.4 quality of service the set of services requested by the ips connected to the network (called network clients) and the mechanisms used to provide these services are commonly referred to as qos. generally, it is useful to classify the trafﬁc across the network into a number of classes, in order to efﬁciently allocate network resources to packets. different classes of packets usually have different requirements in terms of importance, toler- ance to latency, bandwidth, and packet loss. two main trafﬁc categories are speciﬁed: •guaranteed service; •best effort. trafﬁc classes belonging to the former category are guaranteed a certain level of performance as long as the injected trafﬁc respect a well-deﬁned set of constraints.6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 153 trafﬁc classes belonging to the latter category do not get any strong guarantee from the network that instead will simply make its best effort to deliver the packetsto their destinations. best effort packets may then have arbitrary delay, or even be dropped. the key quality of service concern in implementing best effort services is provid- ing fairness among all the best effort ﬂows. two alternative solutions exist in terms of fairness: •latency-based fairness, aiming at providing equal delays to ﬂows competing for the same resource; •throughput-based fairness, aiming at providing equal bandwidth to ﬂows com- peting for the same resource. while latency-based fairness can be achieved implementing a fair arbitration scheme (such as round-robin or less recently used (lru,)), throughput-based fair-ness can be achieved in hardware by separating each ﬂow requesting a resource into a separate queue, and then serving the queues in round-robin fashion. the imple- mentation of such a separation can be expensive; in fact while physical channels(links) do not have to be replicated because of their dynamic allocation, virtual channels and buffers, requiring fifos, have to be replicated for each different class of trafﬁc. so it is very important to choose the proper number of classes needing true isolation, keeping in mind that in many situations it may be possible to combine classes without a signiﬁcant degradation of quality of service but gaining a reductionin hardware complexity. 6.3.2.5 error recovery a high-performance, reliable, and energy-efﬁcient noc architecture requires a good utilization of error-avoidance and error-tolerance techniques, at most levels of its layered organization. modern technologies used to implement the present day systems, in order to reduce power consumption, adopt lower values of the power supply voltage, thus reducing the margins of noise immunity for the signals transmitted over the com- munication network of the system. this leads to a noisy interconnect, behaving as an unreliable transport medium, and introducing errors in the transmitted signals. so the communication process needs to be fault tolerant to ensure correct information transfer. this can be achievedthrough the use of channel coding; channel coding schemes introduce a controlled amount of redundancy in the transmitted data, increasing its noise immunity. linear block codes are commonly used for channel encoding. using an (n,k) linear block code, a data block k bits long is mapped onto an n bit code word, which is transmitted over the channel. the receiver examines the received signal and declares an error if it is not a valid code word.154 a. scandurra once an error has been detected, it can be handled in one of two different ways: •forward error correction (fec), where the properties of the code are used to correct the error; •retransmission, also called automatic repeat request (arq), where the receiver asks the sender to retransmit the code word affected by the error. fec schemes require a more complex decoder, while arq schemes require the existence of a reverse channel from the receiver to the transmitter, in order to askfor the retransmission. 6.4 soc integration issues using the newest cmos technologies, where the dsm effects are so evident, thephysical design of a soc is facing more and more two types of issues: •physical issues , related to the difﬁculties encountered mainly during the place- ment of the hard macros and the standard cells, and during the routing of clock nets and communication system wires; •performance issues , related mainly to the bandwidth requirements of the different ips, that in order to be fulﬁlled, would require socs to run at very high speeds. figure 6.5is an illustration of the physical issues; it shows the ﬂoorplan of an sample cmos chip for consumer application and the interconnect implemented with the vstnoc solution. in this ﬁgure the blue squares are the network interfaces of the various ips of the chip (both initiators and targets), the blue rectangles are the nodes, responsible for arbitration and propagation of information, and the blue lines are the physicalchannels connecting the different noc devices. all these elements must be phys- ically located in the grey area, representing the physical space available for the interconnect. because of the shape (quite irregular and with thin regions) and the area size, it is evident that the placement of the interconnect standard cells can be difﬁcult, and the routing of the wires that can be also very long can suffer fromcongestion. as far as performance is concerned, two main factors inﬂuence the overall oper- ating frequency of a soc, i.e., device switching times and the interconnect offeredbandwidth. current technologies can achieve unprecedented transistor transition frequencies due to short transistor lengths. however, the same is not true for inter- connects. indeed, continually shrinking feature sizes, higher clock frequencies, andgrowth in complexity are all negative factors as far as switching charges on metallic interconnect are concerned. this situation is shifting the ic design bottleneck from computing capacity to communication. feature sizes on integrated circuits and also, therefore, circuit speed have fol- lowed moore’s law for over 3 decades and the cmos integration capability is still increasing. in this respect, according to the international technology roadmap for6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 155 cmos chi p network interf ace noc no deroutingcmos chi p fig. 6.5 cmos chip with vstnoc physical design semiconductors (itrs [ 4]), the rc time constants asocsiated with metallic inter- connects will not be able to decrease sufﬁciently for the high-bandwidth applicationsdestined to appear in the next few years (see fig. 6.6). internal data rates of proces- sors fabricated in deep submicron cmos technology have exceeded gigahertz rates. while processing proceeds at ghz internally, off-chip wires have held inter-chipclock rates to hundreds of mhz. the rate of inter-chip communication is now the limiting factor in high perfor- mance systems. the function of an interconnect or wiring system is to distribute clock and other signals to and among the various circuits/systems on a chip. the fundamental development requirement for interconnects is to meet the high-speedtransmission needs of chips despite further scaling of feature sizes. this scaling down, however, has been shown to increase severely the signal runtime delays in the global interconnect layers. indeed, while the reduction in transistor gate lengthsincreases the circuit speed, the signal delay time for global wires continues to increase with technology scaling, primarily due to the increasing resistance of the wires and their increasing lengths. current trends to decrease the runtime delays,the power consumption, and the crosstalk, focus on lowering the rc-product of the wires, by using metals with lower resistivity (i.e., copper instead of aluminum) and by the use of insulators with lower dielectric constant. examples of the latterinclude nanoporous sioc-like or organic (silk type) materials, which have dielec- tric constants below 2.0 or air gap approaches, which reach values close to 1.8–1.7. integration of these materials results in an increased complexity, however, and they156 a. scandurra fig. 6.6 average interconnect delay as a function of process have an inherent mechanical weakness. moreover, introducing ultra low dielectric constant materials reaches its fundamental physical limit when one considers thatthe ﬁlm permittivity cannot be less than 1. 6.4.1 electrical interconnect classiﬁcation from a technological point of view, interconnects can be classiﬁed in the followingcategories (see fig. 6.7): fig. 6.7 interconnect classiﬁcation from a technological point of view6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 157 •local interconnect , used for short-distance communication, typically between logic units, and comprising the majority of on-chip wires; they have the smallestpitch and a delay of less than one clock cycle; •global interconnect , providing communication between large functional blocks (ips); they are fewer than local interconnects, but are no less important.improving the performance of a small number of critical global links can sig- niﬁcantly enhance the total system performance. global interconnects have the largest pitch and a delay longer than one or two clock cycles typically. •intermediate interconnect , having dimensions that are between those of local and global interconnects. a key difference between local and global interconnect is that the length of the former scales with the technology node, while for the latter the length is approxi- mately constant. from a functional point of view, the two main important and performance- demanding applications of interconnects in soc are signaling (i.e., the communi-cation of different logic units) and clock distribution. in this context they can be classiﬁed as •point-to-point links , used for critical data-intensive links, such as cpu-memory buses in processor architectures; •broadcast links , representing physical channels where the number of receivers (and therefore repeaters) is high and switching activity is also high •network links , targeted at system buses and reconﬁgurable networks, aiming at serving complete system architectures, whose typical communication is aroundseveral tens of gb/s. 6.4.2 electrical interconnect metrics an ideal interconnect should be able to transmit any signal with no delay, no degra- dation (either inherent or induced by external causes), over any distance without consuming any power, requiring zero physical footprint and without disturbing thesurrounding environment. according to this, a number of metrics have been deﬁned in order to characterize the performance and the quality of real interconnects, such as •propagation delay •bandwidth density •power-delay product •bit error rate 6.4.2.1 propagation delay the propagation delay is the time required by a signal to cross a wire. pure intercon- nect delay depends on the link length and the speed of propagation of the wavefront158 a. scandurra fig. 6.8 interconnect delay as function ofinterconnect width (time of ﬂight). electrical regeneration introduces additional delay through buffers and transistor switching times. additionally, delay can be induced by crosstalk. it can be reduced by increasing the interconnect width at the expense of a smaller bandwidth density. technology scaling has insigniﬁcant effect on the delay of an interconnect with an optimal number of repeaters. the minimum achievable interconnect delayremains effectively ﬁxed at approximately 20 ps/mm when technology scales from 90 (year 2004) to 22 nm (year 2016), as shown in fig. 6.8. 6.4.2.2 bandwidth density bandwidth density is a metric that characterizes information throughput through a unit cross-section of an interconnect. generally, it is deﬁned by the pitch of the electrical wires. 6.4.2.3 power-delay product signal transmission always requires power. in the simplest case, it is required to change the charge value on the equivalent capacitor of a metallic wire. in more realistic cases, power will also be required in emitter and receiver circuitry, and inregeneration circuits. a distinction can also be made between static and dynamic power consumption by introducing a factor arepresenting the switching activity of the interconnect link (0<a<1). the power and delay product (pdp) is routinely used in the technology design process to evaluate circuit performance.6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 159 6.4.2.4 bit error rate the bit error rate (ber) may be deﬁned as the rate of error occurrences and is the main criterion in evaluating the performance of digital transmission systems. for an on-chip communication system a ber of 10−15is acceptable; electrical interconnects typically achieve ber ﬁgures better than 10−45. that is why the ber is not commonly considered in integrated circuit design circles. however, future operation frequencies are likely to change this, since the combination of necessarilyfaster rise and fall times, lower supply voltages, and higher crosstalk increases the probability of wrongly interpreting the signal that was sent. errors come from signal degradation. real signals are characterized by their actual frequency content and by their voltage or current value limits. the frequency content will deﬁne the necessary channel bandwidth, according to shannon – hart- ley theorem. analogue signals are highly sensitive to degradation and the preferredmode of signal transmission over interconnect is digital. signal degradation can be classed as time-based, inherent, and externally induced. •time-based: non-zero rise-time, overshoot, undershoot, and ringing time-based degradation can be incorporated into the delay term for digital signals. while the whole of these degradations can be assimilated into a quasi-deterministic behav- ior that does not exceed the noise margins of the digital circuits, a transforma-tion in temporal space is possible (to contribute to the regeneration delay term). this assumption is however destined to disappear with nanometric technologies because of a more probabilistic behavior and especially of weaker noise margins. •inherent: attenuation (db/cm), skin effect, and reﬂections (db). •externally induced: crosstalk (db/cm) and sensitivity to ambient noise. the allowable tolerance on signal degradation and delay for a given bandwidth and power budget forces a limit to the transmission distance. the maximum inter- connect segment length can in fact be calculated, a segment being deﬁned as a por- tion of interconnect not requiring regeneration at a receiver point spatially distantfrom its emission point. signal regeneration in turn leads to a further problem, i.e., the energy used to propagate the signal in the transmission medium can escape into the surroundingenvironment and perturb the operation of elements close to the transmission path. 6.5 on-chip optical interconnect because of the electrical interconnect limitations highlighted in previous section, several researchers have come to the conclusion that “the global interconnect per- formance needed for future generations of ics cannot be achieved even with themost optimistic values of metal resistivity and dielectric constants.” currently, low values of resistivity are 2.2 μohm×cm offered by copper and 1.6 μohm×cm offered by silver, while low values of dielectric constant, lower than 2 (between160 a. scandurra 1.7 and 1.8) are offered by sioc-type nanoporous materials or silk-type organic materials. however, evolutionary solutions will not sufﬁce to meet the performanceroadmap and therefore radical new approaches are needed. several different such possibilities are now envisaged, the most prominent of which are the use of rf or microwave interconnects, optical interconnects, three-dimensional interconnects, and cooled conductors. as industrial partner of two funded european projects (picmos and w adi- mos), stmicroelectronics is currently investigating the optical interconnect solu-tion because of the potential intrinsic advantages of such a technology, i.e., •high bandwidth available thanks to the light frequency (thz); •immunity to noise; •no crosstalk between light beams; •removal of physical issues affecting cmos chip fabrication thanks to a separated photonic interconnect chip. the communication system architecture and the materials used for realizing the optical interconnect play a key role in such a novel approach. a smart choice of the interconnect architecture helps to bypass some physical problems (such as beams crossing, the need for multiple wavelengths emitters, and even the need for extremely high frequencies such as the light frequency), and on theopposite side some intrinsic physical issues drive the choice of the communication system architecture. the key factors are illustrated in the following: •bandwidth : in current socs the bottleneck is the main memory, usually a ddr/ddr2 sdram. due to the clock frequency, data bus size, refresh, page open overhead, and other factors, its available bandwidth is limited. a link able to support a much higher bandwidth is useless if the memory is not able to exploitit; this should lead to the development of memories able to guarantee a higher bandwidth, and allow optimizing the efforts in developing high bandwidth links. •power : according to the consumer market needs, modern socs need to reduce power consumption in order to guarantee a higher life to batteries and to reduce the device heating. low power architecture and design techniques are todaywidely applied, so the high-power potentially consumed by light emitters is a big enemy for the chip industry. •clocking : the complexity of modern systems, together with the collaborations between different industries and organizations, is leading to heterogeneous sys- tems where the different intellectual properties (ips) run at different speeds. this means that the concept of a synchronous system is going to be lost, while theglobally asynchronous locally synchronous (gals) approach will be more and more applied. we will have systems where the different ips are locally clocked by a speciﬁc clock, but at global level they communicate with each other asyn-chronously. the global clock distribution problem could then disappear, and the application of an optical clock to overcome the usual clock tree distribution prob- lem would be not so signiﬁcant.6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 161 •topology : the choice of the on-chip communication architecture impacts its low- level implementation, also in terms of physical issues. it makes sense to have aring or a mesh topology where no crossings are required. this would allow using only one wavelength without the need for multiplexing. also, avoiding cross- ings would make waveguide implementation easier and would reduce undesiredcoupling and degrading effects. •technology : being cmos compatible is the key to having the optical interconnect solution adopted by industries. the implementation of the optical communicationnetwork has to be done keeping the current si-based cmos technology in order to reduce the impact on tools and cost. being able to have standard cells specif- ically for the driving circuitry of both emitters and detectors will be requiredas well. •integration capability : this is another key point. whatever the material will be (si, ge, sige, gaas) there is a need to integrate a huge number of emitters (ormodulators) and detectors, as well as a huge number of waveguides according to the selected topology. current socs are composed of a number of ips of the order of 50–100, so 50–100 emitters (modulators) and detectors would be required on a chip. this must be ensured by the technology. of course the materials and the processes required to implement an on-chip opti- cal interconnect must be cmos compatible . this is the key to guarantee industries will adopt such a novel technological solution with no need for completely changing the design and manufacturing processes, which would have a dramatic impact interms of cost. to guarantee cmos compatibility, an accurate choice of the materials used to build an optical interconnect has to be made. the most promising candidates are asfollows: •iii–v compounded semiconductors (e.g., inp or gaas), giving the best perfor- mance devices, but their integration with silicon-based chips is highly costly atthe moment; growing gaas on si has, for example, a very high cost. however, the integration of iii–v emitters and detectors and soi waveguides on-chip has been demonstrated. •germanium andsi-ge alloys, being fairly easy to grow on si due to their similar lattice structure (they both belong to group iv of mendeleiev’s table); the real- ization of good detectors, compatible with soi waveguides, have been demon-strated. •silicon , giving of course the best advantages in terms of technology since the si planar technology has been stable and widely used for a long time, but the per-formance obtained from si optical devices is currently very low, mainly because of its indirect band gap; moreover, up to now there are no effective si laser sources available, not even exploiting the raman effect, thanks to whom laseremission from si has been demonstrated. soi technology allows the construction of effective optical waveguides exploiting the refraction index difference between si and sio 2.162 a. scandurra 6.5.1 the picmos project the picmos project [ 5] is a european commission funded program, completed on march 2007. the main objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of building an optical interconnect layer on top of cmos. the photonic interconnect layer exploits waferscale technologies as much as possible; a heterogeneous integration technology based on wafer bonding has been developed. the actual information transport medium, being a passive structure, con-sists of high index contrast waveguides in silicon; emitters and detectors, being the active devices, have been fabricated in inp-based materials. for the integration of the photonic interconnect layer with the cmos chip, two different integration strategies have been investigated (see fig. 6.9): •thewafer-to-wafer bonding approach, such that the photonic interconnect layer is fabricated in parallel with and independent of the wafer containing the electronic circuits; subsequently, the latter is wafer bonded to the wafer with the photonicwiring circuits and the required electrical connections are provided using wafer scale technologies; ﬁnally, the wafer is diced and packaged using standard tech- niques; •theabove-ic approach , consisting in fabricating the photonic interconnect layer directly on-top of the electronic circuits. the wafer-to-wafer bonding approach (fig. 6.10) has several advantages; the photonic interconnect layer can be tested before bonding and for its fabricationprocessing steps (e.g., high temperature steps), which are usually not compatible with cmos, back-end processing can be employed. moreover, one could envisage standardized (off-the-shelf) photonic interconnect circuits compatible with multipleelectronic circuit designs. the main advantage of above-ic approach (fig. 6.11) is the on-line integration ability, including the fact that this approach is similar to current cmos-fabrication. fig. 6.9 different approaches for optical interconnect fabrication6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 163 fig. 6.10 wafer-to-wafer bonding approach fig. 6.11 above-ic approach164 a. scandurra both the approaches described in this section rely on a hybrid integration of iii–v devices on a silicon substrate, with different techniques; silicon photonicswould allow both functionality and communication on the same silicon-chip, with big advantages in terms of manufacturing process. so the ability to have efﬁcient optoelectronic devices based on silicon is mandatory to embrace silicon photonicsin a soc networking context. 6.5.2 the wadimos project the objective of the w adimos project [ 6] is to build a complex photonic interconnect layer incorporating multi-channel microsources, microdetectors, and different advanced wavelength routing functions directly integrated with electronic driver circuits and to demonstrate the application of such electro-photonic ics intwo representative applications, as described in the following. •optical network on chip: the main objective of the w adimos project is the realization of an optical noc (onoc) for stmicroelectronics chips. the noc photonic layer will include complex wavelength division multiplexingfunctionality both for increasing the data rate and for increasing the routing ﬂexibility. •terabit optical datalink: mapper lithography is a semiconductor equipment company focusing on the development and manufacturing of a new and highly competitive maskless lithography machine using thousands of electron beams for writing the desired patterns. this requires a data-rate of over 100 tb/sbetween the subfab, where the patterns are generated, and the actual lithography equipment. the onoc [ 7,8] is a novel on-chip communication system where information is transmitted in the form of light, in opposition to what happens in classical elec-trical noc where the information is transmitted in form of voltage levels (and then currents). it relies on the iso-osi protocol stack, and can be seen as being very close to the st noc (vstnoc) architecture, where the physical layer is replaced with a completely new one, exploiting optoelectronics in order to transmit information in the form of light [ 9]. the onoc architecture consists of three main sets of building-blocks: •the initiator optical network interface (ioni) responsible for the conversion of the trafﬁc generated by an initiator into a form suitable to be transmitted in form of light over the onoc reducing to a minimum the amount of “1”s to be trans- mitted, thus limiting the time an emitter is required to be turned on and therebythe power consumption, and, for the actual conversion of information from the electrical form into optical form, by means of information serialization, emitter6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 165 selection, and emitter driving; moreover, to obtain responses (for example, when reading data from memory), a structure replicating the main behavior of the toni(see later) is also implemented. •the lambda-router, responsible for the actual propagation of optical information streams from sources to destinations; •the target optical network interface (toni) responsible for the conversion of information from optical form into electrical form, by means of photocurrent to voltage conversion, level adjustment, and information deserialization and for theconversion of the trafﬁc generated by the onoc receiver into a form suitable to be received by the target. moreover, to send responses, a structure replicating the main behavior of the ioni (see above) is also implemented. such building blocks can be assembled together to build proper on-chip commu- nication architectures, as illustrated in fig. 6.12. from a physical point of view the electronics implementing the driver of emitters and the control of detectors will be in the cmos chip, while the actual emitting and detecting devices will be in the photonic chip where the optical interconnect isfabricated. the link between the cmos electronics and the photonic layer will be a set of vias carrying the information in electrical form from one layer to the other, as shown in fig. 6.13. according to that plan, the placement of the onoc transmitters and receivers within the various ips in the cmos chip has to take into account somehow the placement of the photonic layer above the cmos chip itself, considering that thesize of the photonic layer is usually much smaller than the size of the cmos chip. this means that for the cmos chip a special effort is needed in clustering the different ips, and, within them, clustering the laser drivers and detectors control logic, in order to place properly the vias responsible for the exchange ofinformation between the cmos chip and the photonic layer. this is shown in figs. 6.14 and6.15. fig. 6.12 example of onoc architectureip ip ipip ip ioni ioni ioni toni toni  toni λ-router  ip166 a. scandurra fig. 6.13 connection between a cmos chip and an optical interconnect λ routercmos chi p photonic chi pnetwork interf ace onoc tx/ rx wav eguide fig. 6.14 an optical interconnect above a cmos chip6 silicon photonics: the system on chip perspective 167 cmos chi p routerrouter photonic chi prouter λ routerwav eguidenetwork interf ace onoc tx/ rx fig. 6.15 cmos chip and optical interconnect as two separated chips 6.6 conclusion this chapter describes how silicon photonics could help soc design and implemen- tation from an industrial perspective, based on the vision of stmicroelectronics. the soc concept is introduced, and current soc communication systems aredescribed, highlighting their features and limitations. moving from such limitations, on-chip optical interconnect is described in terms of its potential advantages according to light properties and technology capabili-ties, and the european projects picmos and w adimos are described in order to highlight current work in the ﬁeld of on-chip optical interconnect. overall, this chapter is based on the assumption that, according to current tech- nology capabilities and trends, on-chip optical interconnect will be strongly based on iii–v semiconductors, with all the issues coming from the need for ensuringcmos compatibility. an efﬁcient and reliable silicon photonics would be a big step forward in this ﬁeld.168 a. scandurra references 1. a. scandurra, stbus communication system: concepts and deﬁnitions.

photonic integrated chip on a silicon platform ling liao, ansheng liu, hat nguyen, juthika basak, mario paniccia, yoel chetrit, and doron rubin abstract as microprocessor technology advances toward multi-core and many-core architectures, optical interconnect is considered a promising way of meeting the associated demand for giga-scale and tera-scale input/output (i/o).while traditional optical communication systems demonstrate good performance, they are based on discrete components and are not suitable for computing appli- cations, which require solutions with much lower cost and smaller size. photonicintegration, particularly when based on a silicon platform, has emerged as a key approach to realize the required low cost and small form factor optical transceivers. this chapter highlights a recent demonstration of a silicon photonic integrated chipthat is capable of transmitting data at an aggregate rate of 200 gb/s. it is based on wavelength division multiplexing where an array of eight high-speed silicon opti- cal modulators is monolithically integrated with a demultiplexer and a multiplexer.this demonstration represents a key milestone on the way to fabricating terabit per second transceiver chips to meet the demand of future tera-scale i/o. 7.1 introduction the computer industry is migrating to a many-core processor architecture to main- tain the pace of increasing computational capability while at the same time meetthe energy efﬁciency needs of mobile computing and data center power limits [ 1]. for these new processor designs, power consumption can be optimized by using multiple types of cores tailored to match the needs of different usage models. also,cores that are not busy can be turned off temporarily to reduce power consumption during idle times. while quad-core systems are the state of the art today, computers with tens or even hundreds of cores will be the norm over the next decade. one ofthe challenges with realizing such parallel computing will be the transport of the l. liao, a. liu, h. nguyen, j. basak, and m. paniccia ( b) intel corporation, santa clara, ca 95054, usa y . chetrit and d. rubin ( b) numonyx israel ltd.,

copperinterconnects are being pushed to deliver giga-scale bandwidths with the design of transceivers that use active or passive equalization [ 2,3], this is unlikely to be a frequency scalable option. a subset of the future input/output (i/o) interconnectswill require an aggregate bandwidth of 100’s of gb/s or even tb/s for occasions when most of the cores are operating at the same time, so the need to transmit some of these signals optically is a near certainty. for these interconnections in and around the computer, the optical solution not only needs to meet the performance requirements, it must also be cost effective, compact, and highly integrated. silicon photonics has emerged as a technologyuniquely suited to meet these requirements [ 4,5]. it assures low process develop- ment and manufacturing costs, as it has ready access to the infrastructure, toolsets, knowledge, and capacity that have been and will be developed for silicon micro-electronics. it also beneﬁts from silicon’s proven promise of integration, which should lead to further reduction in cost and size. furthermore, the pace at which the performance of silicon photonic components is advancing demonstrates rapid maturing of this ﬁeld [ 6–21]. integrated tb/s transmitters and receivers on a silicon platform should not be far on the horizon when using wavelength division multi-plexing (wdm) [ 22]. for instance, an integrated 1 tb/s transmitter can be realized by using a multiplexer (mux) to combine 25 laser signals at different wavelengths, each encoded with 40 gb/s data by a silicon modulator. a 1 tb/s receiver is possibleby using a demultiplexer (demux) connected to an array of 25 photodetectors, each receiving 40 gb/s data. to date, all the required optical components have been individually demonstrated on the silicon platform. the natural next step is deviceintegration. this chapter presents a proof of concept demonstration of a silicon photonic integrated chip (pic) where an array of eight high-speed silicon optical modulatorsis monolithically integrated with a wavelength demux and a wavelength mux. the modulators are based on the carrier depletion effect of pn diodes, and the demux/mux is based on a cascaded asymmetric mach zehnder interferometer(mzi) design. this integrated transmitter is capable of sending data at an aggre- gate rate of 200 gb/s over a single ﬁber. section 7.2outlines the architecture of this integrated chip and presents design details for both the modulators and the mux/demux. section 7.3describes device fabrication. section 7.4ﬁrst details the testing results of the individual components that make up the integrated chip,and it then discusses the measured dc as well as high-speed performance of the fully integrated device. 7.2 silicon photonic integrated chip design the silicon pic is based on a silicon-on-insulator (soi) platform. to target high aggregate data transmission over a single ﬁber, an eight-channel wdm design isemployed. figure 7.1shows a top–down schematic of this chip, which includes7 high-speed photonic integrated chip on a silicon platform 171 si mzms1:8 demux  8:1 mux input

an 8:1 multiplexer. a continuous-wave multi-wavelength laser source is outside of the chip. after demux, the individual wave-lengths are modulated by their corresponding silicon modulators a 1:8 demux, 8 high-speed silicon mach-zehnder modulators (mzms), and an 8:1 mux. as fig. 7.1illustrates, a continuous-wave (cw) multi-wavelength laser beam is ﬁrst split by the demux. each wavelength then propagates through itscorresponding modulator. the cw light in each wavelength channel is amplitude modulated by the mzm so that high-speed signal is encoded onto the optical beam. the modulators are followed by the mux, where all eight wavelengths are com-bined into the output waveguide to be coupled off chip. for this transmitter proof of concept demonstration, the laser sources are not integrated onto the silicon chip. while this implementation does not provide the ﬁnal transmitter solution, it is aﬁrst step toward full photonic integration. in the future, the demux in fig. 7.1can be replaced by an array of hybrid lasers [ 21] monolithically integrated on-chip to enable a fully integrated transmitter. the ﬁrst key component of the pic is the high-speed silicon mzm. its operating speed, together with the number of wavelength channels, fundamentally determines the total data transmission capacity of the chip. to achieve >100 gb/s, it is critical to design a high-speed modulator with a data transmission capability greater than 10 gb/s. the silicon modulator design chosen for this demonstration is based on the free carrier plasma dispersion effect [ 23,24], where a change in free carrier distribu- tion alters the refractive index of the material and the optical phase of light passing through it. the absorption coefﬁcient change ( δα) and refractive index change ( δn) in silicon are related to the change in the concentration of electrons (δn e)and holes (δnh)and are generally described by drude–lorentz equations: δα=e3λ2 4π2c3ε0n( δne μe(m∗e)2+δnh μh(m∗ h)2)

change is empirically related to the free carrier density changes (in units of cm−3)a s δn=−(8.8×10−22δne+8.5×10−18δn0.8 h) (7.3) this optical phase shift or modulation can then be converted into the desired optical amplitude modulation using an mzi. to obtain the needed change in car- rier concentration, a pn diode is embedded inside a rib waveguide and is driven inreverse-bias to induce carrier depletion [ 6,7]. because the operation of this device relies on majority carrier dynamics that are inherently fast, this modulator is capable of tens of gb/s bandwidth. figure 7.2is a top-down schematic of this modulator, which has a waveguide-based mzi design with pn diode phase shifters placed in both of its two arms. the waveguide has a 0.6 μm rib width, 0.22 μm rib height, and 0.5μm total height. both modeling and experiment conﬁrm that these cross-section dimensions yield single mode operation for wavelengths around 1,550 nm. the mzi splitter and combiner are both 1 ×2 multi-mode interference (mmi) couplers. figure 7.3is a cross-section schematic of the phase shifter. it has a horizontal junction where the waveguide slab and part of the rib is doped p-type; the remaining top portion of the rib is doped n-type. in this manner, the p-n junction and built-in depletion region is slightly above the center of the optical mode. this design isaimed at optimizing phase efﬁciency because when a reverse-bias voltage is applied, the depletion region widens and sweeps across the mode center, allowing for good charge-mode overlap. to electrically contact the n-type region without additionaloptical loss, a thin silicon layer is grown on top of the rib so that the metal and high concentration doping for ohmic contact are located close to the waveguide but do not overlap the optical mode. to bias the mzm at the quadrature point, a ~2x1 mmipn diode phase shifters rf sourceinput output load resistor~ 1x2 mmi fig. 7.2 top–down view of the silicon mzm. it contains a pn diode phase shifter in each arm as the high-speed modulating element and 1 ×2 mmi couplers as the 3-db splitter and combiner. a thermal heater (not shown) is used to bias the mzi at the quadrature point. on-chip resistors are used to terminate the traveling wave electrodes to reduce rf reﬂection7 high-speed photonic integrated chip on a silicon platform 173 fig. 7.3 schematic of the

oxidesignal ground ground waveguide si substrate thermal heater is included on each arm of the mzi. note that a forward biased pin diode in silicon can also be used for the quadrature tuning and should consume less electrical power. although the silicon modulator based on the reverse-biased pn diode has high intrinsic speed, the actual demonstrated device speed is usually limited by device parasitics. to reduce the capacitance of the phase shifter, the thin silicon cap layerfor metal contact has a single-sided asymmetric design. to further minimize the rc limitation of the frequency response of the modulator [ 25,26], a traveling wave electrode based on a coplanar waveguide structure, as shown in fig. 7.3, is used. the “signal” metal layer is ∼6μm wide and is connected to the n-type silicon region through a 1- μm contact. the separation between the signal and ground metal layers is∼3μm and the metal thickness is ∼1.5μm. the rf traveling wave coplanar waveguide and modulator optical waveguide are carefully designed so that both electrical and optical signals co-propagate along the length of the phase shifter with similar speeds, while, at the same time, the rf attenuation is kept as smallas possible. the transmission line loss, impedance, and phase velocity were calcu- lated using the commercial software package hfss [ 27]. these parameters strongly depend on the metal trace dimensions as well as the silicon doping concentration and proﬁle. to realize high-speed performance, it is also critical to optimize the termina- tion impedance of the traveling wave electrode to minimize rf reﬂections that candegrade signal integrity. this termination resistor is monolithically integrated with the modulator and is made of titanium nitride (tin) thin ﬁlm. the mux/demux is another key component of the integrated chip. in inte- grated photonics, the mux/demux is usually based on an arrayed waveguide grat- ing (awg) [ 28], a planar echelle grating [ 29], or cascaded mzis [ 30]. in this work, the cascading mzi design is chosen. figure 7.4is a schematic representation of the eight-channel mux consisting of 3 stages of asymmetric mzis. each asymmetric mzi consists of a 1 ×2 mmi splitter and a 2 ×2 mmi coupler. each mzi in the third stage has a length difference between the two arms of δl,o f2·δlin the second stage, and of 4·δlin the ﬁrst stage. to compensate for the mzi phase error that can result from fabrication imperfections, a thermal heater is added to each mzi. again, the heaters used in the current design can be replaced by a forward biased pin diode174 l. liao et al. 4·δl2·δlδl stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 1 × 2 mmi 2  × 2 mmiinputoutputs heater (b)(a) fig. 7.4 (a) schematic of a 1:8 demultiplexer based on cascaded asymmetric 1 ×2

waveguide using a fully vectorial mode solver based on the local mode expansion method [ 31]. the mux is designed with 4•δl=97.2μm to target a channel spacing of 3.2 nm (400 ghz) for wavelengths7

couplers, the mmi width is designed to be 7 μm. the length of the 1 ×2 mmi is 54.4 μm, while the length of the 2 ×2 mmi is 220 μm. the mux performance is critically dependent on the behavior of the 2 ×2 mmi coupler, so it is carefully modeled to understand its wavelength dependence both in terms of the splitting ratio anddevice insertion loss. the results are shown in fig. 7.5. note that while the splitting ratio is quite insensitive to the wavelength, the insertion loss has strong wavelength dependence. the operating wavelength range of the mux is therefore primarilylimited by the insertion loss of the 2 ×2 mmis. this simulation result shows that the−0.5 db bandwidth is ∼39 nm. the mmi coupler fabrication tolerance is also modeled. figure 7.6shows the optimal mmi length as a function of mmi width for the wavelength of 1,550 nm. with a ±0.1μm mmi width variation, the correspond- ing mmi length change is about ±4%. such process tolerances can be reasonably met with today’s photo-lithography technology. fig. 7.6 modeled optimal mmi length as a function ofthe mmi width for a 2 ×2 mmi coupler at 1,550 nm. tepolarization was used in thesimulation 6.0 6.4 6.8 7.2

with 1- μm-thick buried oxide and∼0.5μm thick top silicon layer are used as the starting material. regions where the high-speed modulators are to be created are ﬁrst implanted with boron to formthe p-type region of the diode. a single silicon etch step then creates all of the mmi couplers and 0.6 μm wide rib waveguides for the demux, mux, and mzms. a short thermal oxidation is then used as an oxide smoothing step to reduce rib side-wall roughness [ 32], which can dominate passive waveguide transmission loss for the sub-micrometer devices used here. a sio 2deposition and chemical-mechanical polishing (cmp) subsequently planarizes the wafer, with the cmp stopping abovethe waveguide rib. to complete the fabrication of the pn diodes, 2.7- μm-wide trenches are etched in the oxide, asymmetrically positioned above the rib. silicon is then grown usinga non-selective epitaxial process, which ﬁlls the trench with single crystalline sili- con directly above the rib and poly-si above the oxide around the rib. to improve the material quality of the poly-si, the wafers are annealed at 1 ,100 ◦cf o r1 h . this same anneal also serves to uniformly distribute the boron dopants that were previously implanted. a silicon cmp then planarized the wafer and ensured thatthe top silicon layer, also known as the silicon wing, is 0.1 μm thick. phosphorus is then implanted into the wing and rib to form the n-type region of the diode. the p-doping concentration of the diode is targeted to be 1 .5×10 17cm−3, and the n-doping concentration varies from 3 ×1018cm−3near the top of the wing to∼1.5×1017cm−3at the pn junction, which is ∼0.4μm above the buried oxide. to electrically contact the n and p regions, part of the poly-si wing and silicon slab regions on both sides of the rib are heavily implanted with phosphorus and boron, respectively, to reach surface doping concentrations of ∼1×1020cm−3for ohmic contact with the metal. aluminum (al) is then deposited and patterned to cre- ate the traveling wave electrodes and quadrature biasing heaters for the modulators, as well as the thermal heaters for compensating fabrication-induced phase mismatchin the mux/demux mzis. a silicon dioxide (sio 2) layer separates the heaters from the waveguides, so there is no metal induced optical loss. the cross-sectional area of the al heater is approximately 2.5 μm2and the heater lengths for stages 1, 2, and 3 are 797.2, 608.6, and 484.3 μm, respectively. scanning electron microscope (sem) pictures of a pn diode phase shifter and the mux waveguide with al heaterare shown in fig. 7.7a and b, respectively. to monolithically integrate the modulator with the termination resistors, which are needed for high-speed operation, a 0.1- μm-thick tin layer is deposited and patterned to target a resistance value of 15 /omega1. to make electrical contact between the traveling wave electrodes and the tin resistors, another aluminum ﬁlm is deposited and patterned as an interconnecting layer.

performance of its individual components, it is useful to understand each device element ﬁrst. in this manner, the key results of the high-speed modulators, which have been recently shown to transmit data up to 40 gbps [ 7], are presented. this is followed by a discus- sion of the testing results of a single mux. lastly, both dc testing and high-speed data transmission performance of the fully integrated chip are reported. 7.4.1 high-speed performance of the stand-alone silicon mzm one of the device parameters that govern the speed performance of the silicon mzmis the length of the optical phase shifters. shorter length means higher speed because the device has lower rf loss and less electrical-to-optical signal delay or “walk-off.”178 l. liao et al. to demonstrate ultra high-speed performance, a silicon mzm with a 1-mm phase shifter in each arm was previously designed and fabricated. its high frequency per-formance was characterized by measuring both its optical frequency response and data transmission capability. since the modulator has been designed with traveling wave electrodes, it is imperative to ensure proper termination of the transmissionlines to keep the rf signal reﬂections at a minimum. to enable this, two different approaches have been used for device termination. one approach is to ﬂip-chip bond the silicon mzm chip to a printed circuit board (pcb) and surface mount externalresistors on the pcb traces that are connected to the output end of the modulator electrode. the pcb is designed for high-speed performance with low rf loss con- nectors and pcb traces that have 50 ohm impedance at 40 ghz. the other approachfor terminating the device is to monolithically integrate thin ﬁlm resistors onto the silicon modulator die (see fig. 7.8). for the optical frequency roll-off measurement, the signal generator is swept from 100 mhz to 40 ghz. the rf signal is combined with a dc bias using a bias-tee to ensure that the device is always reverse biased. this dc-coupled signal is ﬁrst measured as a function of frequency using a digital communications analyzer (dca) electrical module with 63 ghz bandwidth. the rf signal is then connected to either the pcb or the probes that are used to drive the modulator. the modulatedoptical signal is measured as a function of frequency using a dca 53-ghz optical module. the frequency response of the mzi modulator is obtained by normalizing the optical output by the input drive voltage for all frequencies. this ensures that thefrequency roll-off is independent of any bandwidth limitation of the signal source. the results of the bandwidth measurements for both the device packaged on a pcb as well as that with an on-chip resistor are plotted in fig. 7.9a. one can see that both devices have a 3-db roll-off frequency greater than 30 ghz. the high-speed data transmission performance of the mzi modulator is mea- sured using a pseudo-random bit sequence (prbs) source with [2 31−1]pattern length as the rf input. the output of the prbs source is sent through a modu- lator driver, which is adjusted to give an ampliﬁed output of 6.2 v pp. before being –7–6–5–4–3–2–101 100 10 1 0 frequency

3.1 v dcusing a bias tee to ensure reverse bias operation of the entire ac voltage swing. figure 7.9bs h o w st h e eye diagram of the modulator optical output at a bit rate of 40 gb/s. the extinction ratio (er) is measured to be 1.1 db with a rise/fall time of ∼14 ps. the open eye diagram proves that the modulator is capable of transmitting data at 40 gb/s, whichis consistent with the 3-db roll-off frequency of >30 ghz. while this 40 gb/s performance is unprecedented for a silicon modulator, the device’s ∼1 db er needs improvement. one simple way to achieve higher er is to increase the phase shifter length, thereby increasing the amount of obtainable phase shift for a given applied voltage. the associated drawback is higher rf loss and lower speed performance. for the silicon pic, the length of the phase shifters inside the mzms is chosen to be 1.5 mm as a compromise between speed and er. figure 7.10 shows the data transmission capability of this new design. note that the optical eye diagram is captured at a bit rate of 22.5 gb/s. it shows ∼2 db er and a 18–20 ps rise/fall time. both the open eye diagram and its fast transitions indicate that this device is capable of even higher data transmission rates. 7.4.2 performance of the standalone mux/demux to characterize the performance of the stand-alone 1:8 mux/demux, it is placedon a pcb and the al heaters for phase

a) before and ( b) after thermal tuning optimization can be simultaneously and independently adjusted. light from a polarized broad- band source, a superluminescent light emitting diode (sled), is coupled into andout of the device using lensed single-mode ﬁbers with a mode ﬁeld diameter of 3μm. because the waveguides and mmis have optimum performance for transverse electric (te) polarization, a polarization controller is inserted between the sledand input lensed ﬁber to set the desired polarization. an optical spectrum analyzer (osa) is used to measure the output spectrum. figure 7.11a shows the spectra of all outputs of the eight-channel demux before phase mismatch compensation, and figure 7.11b shows the spectra of the same device after metal heater tuning optimization. the measured on-chip loss is 3.2 db, of which ∼0.6 db is due to the propagation loss of straight waveguides. the channel spacing is 3.2 nm, 3-db bandwidth is 3 nm, and adjacent channel isolation is 13 db. the channel uniformity, deﬁned here as the difference between the bestand worst excess losses over all channels, is ∼1.5 db from 1,537 to 1,562 nm. it is found that the loss slowly decreases as the wavelength increases; this is due to the wavelength dependence of the mmi, which was predicted by simulation. in practice,the wavelength dependence is one of the key factors in determining the operating wavelength range. the tuning efﬁciency of the al heaters, deﬁned as the electrical power needed for π-phase shift, is approximately 83 mw. additionally, the thermal crosstalk is investigated by measuring the phase shift caused by adjacent heaters. it is found to be negligible, where >6 w of electrical power is needed to produce a π-phase shift using a heater on an adjacent mzi. 7.4.3 dc performance of an integrated demux, mzm, and mux chip an integrated device with a single-input waveguide and a single-output waveguide similar to that depicted in fig. 7.1is characterized at dc. it contains a 1:8 demux,7 high-speed photonic integrated chip on a silicon platform 181 8 symmetric modulator mzis, and an 8:1 mux. it differs from the ﬁnal silicon pic in that not all of the doping and metal for high-speed modulation have beenincorporated. like the stand-alone demux, it is also wire-bonded to a pcb so that the heaters can be easily adjusted for phase mismatch compensation. to character- ize this integrated device, the outputs of distributed feedback (dfb) lasers, withwavelengths 3.2 nm apart and comparable output powers, are multiplexed together off-chip using ﬁber-based couplers. this combined output is used as the optical source for testing and is coupled into the silicon device using a lensed polarizationmaintaining ﬁber. again, an osa is used to measure the device output spectrum. figure 7.12a shows the spectrum of the integrated device before and after heater adjustment. with phase mismatch compensation, the channel uniformity improvedfrom 13 to 1.6 db. the on-chip loss is approximately 7.5 db, of which 6.4 db is due to the demux and mux. the remaining 1 db can be accounted for by the modulator mzis placed in between the demux and mux. to quantify the dcer of the silicon mzms, the heater for quadrature biasing is tuned to induce a π–radian phase shift between the two arms of each mzi. the introduction of this π–radian phase difference should result in destructive interference and should lead to minimum optical transmission through the modulator. the output spectrum of the integrated device before and after this heater tuning is given in fig. 7.12b. note that light passing through the adjusted channel, which corresponds to ∼1,533 nm, is at a maximum when there is no phase difference between the two mzi arms and is at a minimum when a π–radian phase is introduced. the resulting er is in excess of 30 db. to verify that the demux is operating correctly such that only one wavelength is propagating through each modulator mzi, the output spectrum the integrateddevice is monitored while the input dfb lasers are selectively switched on or off. figure 7.13 shows the device output spectra for when all the lasers are turned on

device for when all input lasers are turned on and when only those corresponding to channels 2 and 4 are turned on. note that optical cross-talk is betterthan−40 db and when only lasers corresponding to channels 2 and 4 are on. the latter scenario clearly conﬁrms that the input wavelengths are properly demultiplexed because the optical cross-talk, as measured by a comparison of the optical power through “on”channels and “off” channels, is better than −40 db. 7.4.4 high-speed performance of the silicon pic the ﬁnal silicon pic, with the demux, the array of eight high-speed silicon mzms, and the mux, is wire-bonded to a pcb with low loss rf connectors and routing traces. the pcb, as shown in fig. 7.14, is also designed for dc bias con- trol of the metal heaters to tune the phase of the mzms and mux/demux. forhigh-speed testing, the differential rf signals from a prbs generator with [2 31−1] pattern length are ampliﬁed using a commercially available dual-output driver. the fig. 7.14

bias operation for the entire ac voltage swing. this dc-coupled drive signal is supplied to each modulator phase shifter through a high-speed coaxial cable that is attached to the pcb rf connector. the mzi modulators are biased at quadrature for all high-speed measurements. to characterize the silicon pic, the multiplexed outputs of eight dfb lasers is again used as the optical source. on-chip loss is measured to be 10 db, of which 6.4 db is due to the demux and mux, 2 db is due to the high-speed phase shifters,and the remaining 1.6 db is due to the modulator mzis as well as passive waveg- uides used for on-chip optical routing. the high-speed data transmission of the integrated device is tested one channel at a time. figure 7.15 shows the 25 gb/s eye diagrams of the eight wavelength channels. they all yield similar rise time, fall time, and er, which are 19 ps, 19 ps, and 2 db, respectively. these performance results are very similar to those obtained for the stand-alone mzm; this close matchis a good indication that device integration did not compromise performance. clear open eye diagrams at 25 gb/s suggest that the si pic is capable of transmitting data at an aggregate data rate of 200 gb/s. 7.5 conclusion this chapter presents the design, fabrication, and performance of a wdm-basedsilicon optical transmitter that monolithically integrates an array of eight high-speedsilicon modulators with silicon based 8:1 demux/mux. the inclusion of both a demux and a mux allows for ﬁber-to-chip coupling using a single input and a single output ﬁber. the silicon mzm is based on the free carrier plasma disper-sion effect, which is obtained through electric-ﬁeld-induced carrier depletion of a pn diode embedded inside a rib waveguide. to enable high-speed performance, a traveling wave electrode design is used to allow co-propagation of the optical and electrical waves. termination resistors are also monolithically integrated with the electrodes to minimize rf reﬂections that can compromise signal integrity. themux/demux is based on cascaded mzis with integrated metal heaters to allow compensation of mzi phase error that can result from device fabrication. the silicon photonic integrated chip has a total on-chip optical loss of 10 db, of which ∼3.5 db is due to the high-speed silicon mzms and the remaining is due to the demux/mux. high-speed testing shows that all eight modulators are functional and are each capable of at least 25 gb/s data transmission. the siliconpic is therefore capable of an aggregate data rate of 200 gb/s. this is an important demonstration of the beneﬁts of silicon photonic integration and its feasibility as a platform for future high-speed interconnects. acknowledgments the authors thank fiel

optoelectronics integration thierry pinguet, steffen gloeckner, gianlorenzo masini, and attila mekis abstract we describe the intimate relationship between process, devices, and system design by examining the development of luxtera’ s cmos photonics tech- nology. we address the challenges of integrating optoeletronic elements, includ- ing germanium photodiodes, in a commercial cmos process without signiﬁcantlyaffecting the electronics performance and the manufacturability of the process. the common practices of the electronics design and manufacturing industry are applied to our optoelectronic technology; we discuss our device library and our design and testing infrastructure in support of the engineering of complex optoelectronic cir- cuits and systems. finally, we use a complete monolithically integrated wavelengthdivision multiplexed 40 gbps transceiver chip as an example of the application of our complete technology platform and the demonstration of its capabilities for opto- electronic integration. 8.1 introduction silicon photonics as a discipline exploits the optical and electrical material proper-ties of silicon. various integration schemes that embed the silicon photonic devicesinto higher level systems have been reported and cover the whole spectrum from hybrid to monolithic implementations [ 1–3]. luxtera has taken a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cmos) ﬁrst- approach to silicon photonics, incrementally adding process modules to a well- characterized and maintained cmos-process baseline in order to enable the optical functionalities. this approach is driven by the desire to leverage the advanced fabri-cation processes run on state-of-the-art toolsets as well as the continuous improve- ment efforts in all aspects of cmos-design and manufacturing, but also by the economic reality of the tremendous costs involved in building and maintaining an t. pinguet ( b) luxtera inc., carlsbad, ca 92011, usae-mail:

not allow building and supporting such a fab purely from an emerging optoelectronic application. luxtera is a commer- cial entity and this has strongly impacted the selected integration approach. in ourview, applications, technology, and devices cannot be considered in isolation and trade-offs in devices and technology need to be cross-checked against application requirements. the application deﬁnes the required functionalities and to some extent the perfor- mance of the devices and we have found in our work here that the coupling between system, devices, and process is extremely tight (illustrated in fig. 8.1). just like in electronics, optical device performance is bounded by the capabilities of the cmos technology and its limitations at a particular process generation (i.e., lithography, etch depth control, etc.). as such, the improvement path for the devices is closelytied to process improvements. better individual devices can be realized in different material systems, but these so far do not support high levels of system integration. the beneﬁts of integration then will most likely be realized at the system level ratherthan at the device level. preferred applications have a predictable roadmap that can be intersected by predictable advances in cmos technology. luxtera selected opti- cal interconnects as the target application space due to the required scaling both in performance (speed, power) as well as market-volume (cost) that match scaling characteristics usually associated with cmos technology. in sect. 8.2we describe how photonic functionality was integrated into a cmos- process ﬂow. aside from laser light sources, luxteras cmos photonics technology integrates all components required for optical transceivers. our approach towarddevice development was also strongly guided by methodologies used in the cmos- industry, which we will describe in sect. 8.3. section 8.4gives an overview on design and testing infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for design and design ver-iﬁcation of integrated optoelectronic systems. finally, in sect. 8.5we describe an integrated optoelectronic transceiver system, which served as a demonstration vehi- cle verifying the design ﬂow around which luxteras cmos-photonics technologyhas been constructed. 8.2 enabling a cmos process for photonics integration the idea of using silicon as a material for photonic integration has been investigatedfor decades [ 4] ever since the rise of microelectronics as an industry and the large investment in tools and processes associated with silicon fabrication. beyond sim- ply using silicon as a source material to build optical-only integrated devices and8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 189 circuits (like for instance silica-on-silicon photonic lightwave circuits), many differ- ent approaches have been proposed to achieve tight integration between photonicsand electronics on a silicon substrate [ 5,6]. the path followed by luxtera was to integrate all photonic components in the front-end of a standard cmos process. in this section we describe the challenges encountered and eventual selections madeduring the development process and we hope to make evident that there is a large gap between claiming cmos compatibility, and actually achieving it. 8.2.1 rationale for front-end integration luxtera’ s philosophy is to extend the general electronics design and fabrication processes to optical components: we want photonics to be just another part of the toolkit that an integrated circuit designer can use to create complex circuits and systems with additional functionality. thus we want optical components to becomebasic elements just like transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc. additionally, we want them to be built in the same silicon, at the same time as the basic electrical devices, so that they are completely compatible with cmos and can beneﬁt from advance-ments in silicon processing. those considerations were the driving factors behind front-end integration. figure 8.2 shows a schematic cross-section of the front-end integration approach, showing the monolithic integration of electronics (transistor), passive optical devices (waveguide), active optical devices (modulator), and photodetec-tion (ge-based waveguide photodetector), all of which are discussed in subsequent sections. evidently, the only element of an optical data transmission link that is missing is the light source. while research is ongoing on the monolithic integration of optical fig. 8.2 schematic cross-section of a photonically enabled cmos process190 t. pinguet et al. gain media in silicon [ 7,8], the various technologies at the time of writing are far too immature for commercial deployment, so luxteras products rely on an externallaser hybridly co-packaged with the cmos photonic chip. 8.2.2 soi substrate design silicon-on-insulator (soi) substrates have traditionally been the wafers of choice for fabricating optical devices, since they provide a high-quality crystalline silicon layer over a silicon dioxide buried layer which acts as a built-in cladding layer for any waveguide-based device. over the last 10 years, soi has also become a standard technology for microelectronics, thus promoting the development of soi substrates.naturally then, a cmos soi process would be an excellent candidate as a starting point for photonic integration. at the time of the start of development of luxtera’ s process, some soi pro- cess nodes were available and the state of the art was around 130–90 nm (referring to the half pitch of the ﬁnest metal lines printable in that process). freescale (at the time still motorola) agreed to become luxteras partner for development, giv-ing us access to their 130 nm soi process. this process was extensively used for building high-performance powerpc microprocessors. a 130-nm soi process was also a good choice because it provides sufﬁcient electronics performance to design10 gbps analog circuits used in communication systems (trans-impedance ampli- ﬁers, modulator drivers, clock and data recovery circuits, etc.). unfortunately, while this appeared like a marriage made in heaven, soi substrate thicknesses designed forelectronics tend to have relatively thin top silicon layers, on the order of 100 nm or less in more advanced nodes. this thickness is practically incompatible with design- ing high-conﬁnement single-mode waveguides: the optical mode at wavelengths ofinterest (considered to be in the 1,310–1,550 nm range in this chapter) would extend well outside of the silicon, resulting in side-effects: low efﬁciency of any electro- optic effect where overlap with silicon is necessary, degraded bending radius, and the need to have a very thick buried silicon dioxide layer to prevent leakage to the silicon substrate (which would create high propagation loss in waveguides).increasing the top silicon thickness was thus needed to enable high performance optical elements, but at the penalty of changing (not necessarily degrading) the per- formance of the transistors compared to the starting process. while this does notsound like a large issue, it triggers additional development efforts, like for instance the need to re-extract models for all electrical devices in the process. good models are necessary to design high-yield circuits in cmos. the selection of the ﬁnal topsilicon thickness for luxtera (in the range of a few hundreds of nanometers) was the result of a global optimization of multiple parameters: transistor behavior, waveg- uide loss, grating coupler efﬁciency (see subsequent section), modulator efﬁciency,etc., with the goal to build an optical data transmission system. for a different target application the optimization and selection of thicknesses could have been different.8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 191 8.2.3 waveguide integration once the substrate was selected, the next task was to ensure that the most basic of devices, the waveguide, provided sufﬁcient performance to be usable. much research has been performed on processes to realize low-loss waveguides in silicon[9,10]. special processes have been studied, demonstrating a reduction in waveg- uide loss, for instance by improving the sidewall roughness of etched rib waveguides or other sidewall-related effects by treatment of the etched surface. unfortunately,few, if any, of these processes have been demonstrated to translate directly to a cmos process, and additionally, most of the research has failed to deal with other aspects of waveguides in a cmos process, in particular the effect of the rest of thecmos process on the waveguide loss and other performance parameters. in a cmos process, other effects have an impact on the performance of the optical devices, for instance: – the presence of other process dielectrics on the silicon layer or near the waveguide – the oxidation/strip/clean cycles of the exposed silicon surface (used to reduce surface states for electronics performance) – subsequent steps like implantation, anneals, and other thermal treatments (which could impact for instance the stress in the silicon ﬁlm) extensive characterization of the local environment of the waveguide, in particu- lar the dielectric ﬁlms in contact with the silicon, is necessary to quantify its impact on waveguide loss. in luxtera’ s process (fig. 8.3), the waveguide is a rib waveguide deﬁned by a partial etch of the silicon layer, and is covered with a set of silicon nitride and oxynitride layers that are part of the standard cmos, to block salicidation locally or form a gate spacer layer. the sidewalls of the waveguide go through the same fig. 8.3 cross-section scanning-electron microscope picture of rib waveguide and its local environment192 t. pinguet et al. fig. 8.4 multimode waveguide loss and its variation through the process ﬂow oxidation/strip/clean steps as the sidewall of the silicon islands that will eventually form the body of transistors. beyond the ﬁrst couple of dielectric layers lie low-kdielectrics used in the back-end. we showed that the ﬁrst two metal levels and asso- ciated dielectrics had an impact on the waveguide loss. we removed wafers from the process ﬂow at different points of the process, not letting them ﬁnish the complete ﬂow, to observe the effects of various process steps on waveguide loss. figure 8.4shows the evolution of loss with process steps. there is clear evidence that waveguide loss is strongly affected by many other aggres- sors besides sidewall formation. photolithography, due to its impact on the local waveguide geometry, is a key driver of optical loss performance. figure 8.5shows a comparison of optical propagation loss for the same waveguide design printed with 248-nm lithography versus 193-nm lithography. 8.2.4 photolithography beyond providing beneﬁts to waveguide loss, as we have just shown, the contin- ual reduction of feature sizes driven by the electronics industry has ﬁnally reacheda point where it can beneﬁt and even enable novel photonic devices beyond the research laboratory. in the past, very small features (on the scale of a quarter the wavelength of light) could only be printed reliably using an electron-beam tool.but this restricted the designs to small areas and it is not at this point a volume- capable production tool. in luxteras process, a single photolithography step is used to deﬁne all optical devices (except for ge devices). the lithography is performed8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 193 fig. 8.5 improvement of waveguide propagation losswith lithography technology in an advanced 193-nm stepper and is used to print a wide array of different features that are completely different from what is traditionally printed in electronic circuits (often referred to as manhattan geometries, only oriented along xand yaxes): straight and curved waveguides, tapers, arrays of holes, arrays of curved gratings, etc. in the 193-nm-based process we can print features as small as 100 nm reliably (see fig. 8.6), and this also provides a side-beneﬁt: larger feature sizes are much better controlled and have less variability in their dimensions across a ﬁeld or a wafer, or even from wafer to wafer and from lot to lot. 8.2.5 active optical device integration as discussed previously, a single photolithography step is used to deﬁne all opti-cal devices in the silicon layer. ge-based devices require the additional step of growing the ge ﬁlm, which is discussed below. other active optical devices in our fig. 8.6 examples of optical features printed with 193 nm lithography194 t. pinguet et al. process (mainly, modulators, either of amplitude or of phase, see sect. 8.3)r e l yo n carrier-based mechanisms to create electro-optical effects [ 11,12]. we use standard implantation techniques to create the doping proﬁles needed for the various devices. the implant steps used for our modulators are integrated with the standard nwell and pwell implant modules, and use the same implanter tools, as well as the sameactivation steps, thus not necessitating additional thermal treatment. various implant dopings are used, most of them sharing a similar proﬁle in an attempt to achieve a uniform doping across the thickness of the silicon with different peak densities. eachdoping proﬁle is typically a multi-step implant module, where at least two different doping peaks provide a quasi-uniform proﬁle in the vertical direction. a modulator device will typically contain multiple implants, for instance to achieve low dopingin areas where low optical loss is desired, and high doping in areas where low series resistance is needed. to provide contacts to the active optical devices, including ge photodiodes, we use the standard contact module of the original cmos process and the standard source/drain implants and salicidation to provide ohmic contacts to silicon (our ge module uses different implants and no salicidation to provide contacts to ge), as shown in fig. 8.3. salicidation is blocked over the waveguiding region where the optical mode resides (or else optical propagation loss would be extremely high) bythe presence of a dielectric layer. that layer is not present over the contact area. the contact module is designed for a wide range of topography in the original process: contact to the silicon layer, contact to the top of the gate, and contact to the substrate.thus, it can easily handle contacting our optical devices as well as the ge layer, as long as it does not differ too much in thickness from the transistor gate poly layer. 8.2.6 germanium module the use of ge and sige alloys has been proposed for photonics applications, as well. sige has higher refractive index than si and its absorption edge extends fur- ther in the near infrared allowing efﬁcient light absorption at the wavelengths used in optical communications. discrete ge detectors compete with iii–v ones in themarket of near infrared photodetection by offering a cheaper product though limited in use to the c-band (around 1,550 nm) with the absorption coefﬁcient of ge being too low in the l-band (1,600 nm) to provide efﬁcient photoresponse. at much lowerspeed, when the size of the sensitive area is a key factor, ge detectors are preferred to ingaas, once again for cost reasons. ge-on-si based photodetectors [ 13] have been investigated since 1966 [ 14], and high-speed waveguide sige devices were demonstrated in the 1980s at bell labs [15]. those pioneering works evidenced the importance of a buffering technique in the epitaxial growth to reduce and conﬁne the defects (dislocations) far from theactive region of the device while enabling a planar, smooth two-dimensional growth of the semiconductor ﬁlm. the limits of sige alloys and superlattices in access- ing the iii window of optical communications (1,550 nm) even using a waveguide8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 195 conﬁguration [ 16] triggered a new effort at the end of the 1990s to identify a suitable epi technique enabling the growth of photodetector-grade ge ﬁlms on si substrates.a few buffering techniques were proposed and investigated in those years. among them, the most relevant are the gradual buffer approach (sometimes including a chemical-mechanical polishing step about half way from si to ge) detailed in [ 17] and the low temperature buffer originally introduced in [ 18]. while the former yields ﬁlms of higher quality (record low dislocation counts have been reported using this technique complemented by cyclic annealing steps [ 19]), the latter is preferred for integration with cmos for its lower thermal budget and total thickness/growth time required. surface illuminated and waveguide photodetectors using variants of the low temperature buffer method have been reported with very high efﬁciency andspeed by several groups [ 20,21]. recently, luxtera demonstrated waveguide ge photodetectors integrated in a cmos process using a low temperature process [ 22] and we discuss in the next section the challenges of the integration of the ge modulein the cmos ﬂow. 8.2.6.1 germanium module integration the integration of ge to enable photodetectors in a cmos process requires a care- ful identiﬁcation of constraints imposed by the baseline process and the desire to minimize changes and subsequent process development. such a module consists of a signiﬁcant number of additional steps, and interactions between these steps andearlier and later stages of the process require a development approach that addresses these challenges from the start. three main factors drive the choice of processes and device architecture in the integration process: thermal budget, contamination, and device size. thermal budget constraints dictate the placement of the ge epi step after the main doping and the poly annealing step have been performed since ge cannot withstand their temper-ature. on the other side, todays low-k backend ﬁlms are not compatible with the temperatures required during ge epi. as a consequence, the growth of the ge ﬁlm must be placed somewhere before the contact module and after the poly gate for-mation. luxteras process inte- grates ge after salicidation to minimize interactions with the critical transistor spacers (see fig. 8.7). fig. 8.7 schematic of location of ge module within cmos process ﬂow196 t. pinguet et al. compatibility with cmos backend processes in essence restricts the device architecture to a waveguide-based photodetector. the headroom limits imposedby the planarization techniques (cmp) in todays technologies force the maximum height of the ge ﬁlm used for the photodetector to be less than a few hundred nanometers (the space between the si surface and the ﬁrst metal level in a typicalcmos process). this rules out completely the possibility to use surface illuminated devices. the latter, indeed, would require a ﬁlm thickness of 3–4 μm, at the wave- length of 1,550 nm, to absorb efﬁciently the light. fortunately, the waveguide con-ﬁguration relaxes this constraint due to the light propagation in the wafer plane thus transforming a thickness requirement into length. the ﬁlm must be thick enough to admit optical modes at the chosen wavelength, which is possible thanks to the veryhigh refractive index of ge (about 4). the waveguide conﬁguration is appealing also for its potentially higher speed, when compared to the surface illuminated one. by decoupling the absorption from the collection length (the former along the lightpropagation path, the latter perpendicular to it), the waveguide design allows an almost independent optimization of both. in other words, speed can be optimized without compromising the photoresponse. the luxtera process uses the selective growth of ge in recesses opened in a dielectric stack to form the body of the photodetector (see ﬁgure top view sem).after the si surface is cleared in the selected areas, the wafer is cleaned using a wet process and introduced in the epi chamber. the selective growth is preceded by an in situ cleaning step aimed at removing the residual oxygen contaminationand creates a ﬁlm 300 nm thick. the wafer is, then, deposited with a dielectric ﬁlm which protects the semiconductor during the following lithographically deﬁned implant steps. at the end of this process the protective dielectric ﬁlm is patternedand the wafer proceeds through the standard contact module and the rest of the back-end. the luxtera process uses the selective growth of ge in recesses opened in a dielectric stack to form the body of the photodetector (see fig. 8.8). after the si surface is cleared in the selected areas, the wafer is cleaned using a wet process and introduced in the epi chamber. the selective growth is preceded by an in situ fig. 8.8 top view sem of ge boxes selectively grownover silicon8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 197 cleaning step aimed at removing the residual oxygen contamination and creates a ﬁlm 300 nm thick. the wafer is then coated with a dielectric ﬁlm, which protects thesemiconductor during the following lithographically deﬁned implant steps. at the end of this process the protective dielectric ﬁlm is patterned and the wafer proceeds through the standard contact module and the rest of the back-end process. 8.2.7 process control and monitoring the last critical piece of the process development involved the creation and/or selection of appropriate process control monitors. typically a cmos manufacturing line will employ of combination of built-in equipment monitors (pressure gauges,temperature sensors, etc.), metrology (critical dimension measurements, etch depth measurements using sems and atomic force microscopes or proﬁlometers), and inline electrical probing (measured when the ﬁrst metal interconnect layer is avail- able, and then again at the end of the line). there is an extensive infrastructure of tools and measurement equipment that has been developed to support this activityin the semiconductor industry, with two primary goals: control the various process steps and be able to react quickly when the process gets out of control, and screen and scrap bad wafers as early as possible in the line to minimize cost. during our development efforts, the issue of appropriate process control monitors and wafer acceptance criteria became extremely critical. for instance, the critical dimensions of the optical devices (width of features, etch depth) are primary driversof the ﬁnal optical performance, and needed to be tightly controlled. the lithography and etch steps deﬁning the optics occur essentially at the very beginning of the process, so it would be extremely costly to carry out optical probing at the end ofthe line to determine whether the process yielded in-spec optical devices. bringing optical probing into the fab quickly proved to be an unfeasible proposition (due to non-standard equipment and lack of trained operators). luxtera, in conjunction with our manufacturing partner, ended up developing a set of structures used for inline metrology and inline electrical testing. these struc- tures were carefully designed and measured to generate data that could be directly correlated to ﬁnal device performance. examples of such structures included the following: – arrays of holes and line/spaces of various dimensions measured by critical- dimension (cd)-sem and wafer-scale afm, – inline electrical structures (diffusion resistors, capacitors, diodes) used to validate correct processing of our active optoelectronic devices, – ring oscillators with optoelectronic devices built in to determine yield of high- speed integrated optoelectronic circuits (for instance a modulator with driver). it was necessary to run a signiﬁcant number of wafers and lots (on the order of 30 lots of 25 wafers) to extract the true variability of the process and create statistical models and come to a frozen process with well-understood characteristics and capable process monitors.198 t. pinguet et al. 8.2.8 other integration elements figure 8.9shows a summary schematic of all the requisite incremental modiﬁca- tions to the original cmos process to enable photonics. in addition to the critical elements discussed above, the ﬁgure shows some other issues to be overcome whenintegrating photonics in the front-end: – ensuring planarity of the silicon and silicon dioxide trench ﬁll after cmp is crit- ical but made difﬁcult by the widely different densities of features on the optical devices versus transistors in our dual-trench approach. care has to be taken to match densities across designs to ensure compliance with process targets. – data processing of the various design layers had to be modiﬁed slightly to add compatibility with optical devices and to block nefarious effects of many process steps. for instance, many implant layers are derived from other design layers (forinstance, n-type implant mask = not p-type implant mask) and could result in the unintentional implantation of optical devices, so blocking layers have to be employed, and boolean operations have to be modiﬁed to take this into account. – tiling of metal layers (which is usually an automated step that ﬁlls empty areas of metal masks with dummy structures to equalize density, again for cmp processwindow purposes) has to be controlled to keep some empty areas untiled. this is to allow light to travel through the back-end of the chip between the grating couplers etched in the silicon layer and the top surface of the chip where lightmay couple to/from an optical ﬁber or a hybridly attached laser. fig. 8.9 process ﬂow of photonically enabled cmos process8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 199 in the next section, we discuss the concept of a device library and our develop- ment approach. 8.3 photonic device library 8.3.1 electronics libraries: the inspiration luxtera’ s photonic device library was modeled on electronic circuit design libraries. an electronic library is built on simple elements whose physics is well-understood and whose performance is thoroughly characterized. these elements include tran- sistors, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. the library does not simply contain the layouts for these elements but also models that describe their behavior as a func-tion of inputs to the device, such as voltage or current, as well as their sensitivities to environmental conditions, such as temperature. in addition, the models contain information on how the performance changes with process variability, with best,typical, and worst cases traditionally called process corners. from the basic elements, simple cells can be built, for example, logic gates for a digital library or ampliﬁers for an analog library. these lower level ele-ments can then be further referenced in higher level blocks and subsystems, such as driver circuits or digital-to-analog or analog-to-digital converters (dacs and adcs). because each of the building blocks has been comprehensively character-ized, it is possible to simulate the behavior of the blocks accurately and derive their range of performance due to natural variations in the fabrication process. even though complex electronics blocks may contain millions of basic elements, they are always built up in a hierarchical form. this approach allows top-level simu- lations to be tractables, as they can reference simulation results for smaller blocks in the hierarchy. the hierarchical design based on precise models allows the designer to devise complex systems accurately to given speciﬁcations. 8.3.2 library hierarchy and design flow luxtera’ s photonic device library is built up in a fashion analogous to its electronic counterpart. the library begins with a collection of optical and opto- electronic elements that serve as a starting point for building complex pics. these basic pho- tonic elements, such as waveguides, ﬁber-to-chip couplers, light modulators, andreceivers are treated in a similar fashion to transistors and resistors in a library of electronic circuits. the photonic library is fully integrated with the electronic library so that the two types of elements seamlessly combine to construct optoelectronicblocks. as an example, let us consider a high-speed modulator subsystem, built up hier- archically from elements of different complexities. figure 8.10 shows a schematic of a simpliﬁed hierarchy of the high-speed modulator. the subsystem comprises two main blocks, a mach-zehnder interferometer (mzi) modu- lator and a control block200 t. pinguet et al. fig. 8.10 sample library hierarchy: the high-speed modulator that controls the relative dc optical phase of the two arms. the mzi modulator block further consists of waveguides, y-junctions, transmission lines, and several modulator sections, each instance of the latter being made of a pn-diode with aunit driver circuit. the control block con- tains a phase control block and a control signal acquisition block. the former comprises a thermal phase modulator (tpm) phase tuner, driven by a tpm driver controlled by a dac from the control bus. the latter employs optical taps feeding the light from the waveguides into monitor photodiodes, whose signal in turn is converted to a digital signal by an adc. the design of each of the basic components follows a well-deﬁned ﬂow, shown schematically in fig. 8.11. it begins with a device concept that is naturally con- strained by the process. the design selection phase employs a design methodologybased on a design-of-experiment (doe) approach and relies on the testing infras- tructure providing an accurate and automated test capability. the outcome of the third phase design veriﬁcation is a model that describes the performance of thelibrary element. the models provide the performance of each fundamental element as a function of the process variations as well as other inputs to the device, such as wavelength or temperature. in the next subsections we describe the main steps in thedesign ﬂow and illustrate our approach with an application to the design of a grating coupler. 8.3.3 device concepts the photonic device concepts are enabled by our integration approach, which con- sists of adding photonics capability into a cmos process with minimal changes to8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 201 fig. 8.11 overview of device design ﬂow the baseline process. this philosophy allows carrying forward the existing electronic cells with the least amount of modiﬁcations. admittedly, the approach also puts some limits on the component design. as an example of what constraints the process requirements may place on device concepts, let us consider how to transfer the light signal from a ﬁber into the cmos die. the common approach of edge-coupling is not possible in a cmos process because of the existence of a guard ring around the edge of the chip. this ring comprises metal lines and it has a two fold purpose. it prevents mobile ions fromentering the transistors in the chip and bars cracks from propagating to the inside of the chip. light signals propagating through the guard ring would suffer prohibitively high losses for this approach to be feasible. one solution is to access the chip surface for light transfer. just as electri- cal signals enter the cmos chip through wirebonds from the top side of the die through bond pads, we can envision “optical bond pads” where the ﬁber is posi-tioned along the normal to the chip. the light is then “bent” using a photonic library element and directed into waveguides inside the chip. the advantage of such an approach is that the optical interface can now placed virtually anywhere on the two-dimensional surface of the die, providing much more ﬂexibility in the pic layout compared to the case where optical signal entry is restricted to points along the die edge.202 t. pinguet et al. another issue that one must contend with, whether we use edge or surface cou- pling, is that the fundamental mode size is orders of magnitude smaller in a silicon-based system on the chip than in standard single-mode ﬁbers. it is again cmos compatibility that restricts the design space. to be able to utilize the same silicon ﬁlm for the optical waveguides and the transistor bodies, the waveguide must bebuilt in a thin layer, resulting in a small fundamental mode. figure 8.12 illustrates the coupling scheme employed on our cmos platform. the ﬁber is aligned near normal to the chip and is attached to a polarization split-ting grating coupler (psgc) built into the silicon optical layer. the curved lines represent bent diffractive gratings comprising the coupler and the solid arrows show the direction of light propagation. the gratings have two functions. they scatterlight from the ﬁber into the slab waveguides into which the waveguide is etched, redirecting the light by about 90 ◦. the light is at the same time focused in the transverse direction inside the slab due to the curvature of the grating. the unetchedhorn-shaped triangular sections of the coupler allow for a smooth transition between the slab waveguides and the narrow single-mode waveguides used in the pic. to achieve high coupling efﬁciency for both polarization modes in the ﬁber, two sets of gratings are overlaid in a perpendicular conﬁguration. they redirect light with the appropriate linear polarization into their respective waveguides. the polar-ization of the light in each waveguide as well as in the ﬁber is shown in fig. 8.12 with dashed arrows. as a polarized coherent beam propagating in the ﬁber can always be written as a linear combination of two orthogonal linearly polarized components,this device can efﬁciently couple light in any polarization into the chip. by appro- priately designing the coupler, it is possible to ensure that light in all polarizations experiences the same coupling loss. this coupling approach is unlike many other polarization diversity schemes where the two polarization modes in the ﬁber couple into the two orthogonally fig. 8.12 schematic view of the polarization-splitting grating coupler with a ﬁber8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 203 polarized modes of a single waveguide and then separated out inside the chip to be processed individually. in our approach, the two orthogonal polarizations areseparated spatially as soon as light enters the chip. the other difference between this and edge-coupling schemes is that both waveguides carry the light signal in the same fundamental transverse-electric (te)-polarized mode, not in a te-mode inone waveguide and a transverse magnetic (tm)-mode in the other waveguide. 8.3.4 design selection: the design-of-experiment approach after formulating the device concept, the next step in the design ﬂow is optimizingthe device in the given process. regardless of whether a library element is relativelysimple, like a waveguide, or more complex, like a psgc, it can be described in terms of a number of parameters, or factors, that determine the response of the device. the factors can be deﬁned by the design, by the process, or by environmental conditions. for instance, some of the design parameters of the psgc are the number of scattering elements in the grating, their positions in the plane, the width of theinput waveguide, the angle of the horn, or the distance of the grating from the input waveguides. process factors can be the thickness and refractive index of the silicon ﬁlm as well as that of the backend dielectrics above the coupler. in addition, thereare environmental parameters, such as the angle of the ﬁber attached to the chip or the chip temperature. once all the factors are enumerated, the device response parameters are deﬁned, which then fully describe the performance of the particular device. for the psgc, the response is the transmission efﬁciency as a function of wavelength and the polar- ization of the light incident onto the grating. we can further simplify this set ofresponses by deﬁning a parameterized version of the spectrum. one option is to describe the spectrum in terms of peak wavelength, minimum loss, 1 db bandwidth, and polarization-dependent loss. the psgc then can be considered a black box that takes the factors and turns them into responses, as illustrated in fig. 8.13. each factor can vary, be it via design or layout changes, through natural variations in the process, deliberate pro- cess changes, or through variations in environmental conditions. fig. 8.13 input factors and response204 t. pinguet et al. armed with a list of parameters, the next step is to quantify the effect of each fac- tor on each response. we can use the design-of-experiment (doe) approach to mapefﬁciently the effects on the responses as well as interactions between the factors. a systematic approach clears away two main types of stumbling blocks in approaching relatively complex designs like that of the psgc. we have avoided the approach that ﬁnds an ideal value for the parameters sep- arately because in the presence of interactions, a design determined in this fashion frequently turns out not to be a global optimum. this is because the optimum insome factors is a strong function of the value of other factors, which is due to the interaction between the parameters. in the doe methodology, the experimental points cover the full n-dimensional parameter space deﬁned by the nparameters. with such an approach, we were able to locate the optimum design point with a single set of experiments. we used the doe methodology fully to our advantage when the number of fac- tors is large and all interactions between them need to be mapped out. for the pho- tonic elements, like the psgc, the number of input parameters is frequently in the dozens when all effects are carefully considered. if each parameter was varied inde- pendently, the number of experiment would scale exponentially with the number of factors. the doe approach can be very economical in that, if appropriately used,the scaling with the number of factors is much weaker. for instance, the parameter space for a design with eight parameters can be fully mapped using a cubic-centered doe design with only 82 points, whereas a set of experiments where all parameterstake three values would contain 3 8= 6,561 points. due to the large number of factors, in the design ﬂow we ﬁrst run a screening doe to identify the most important factors. this experiment has two major goals:(1) ﬁnding the few input parameters that have the greatest effect on each of the responses and (2) identifying the strongest interactions between the factors. the factors we choose for the experiment include both design and process parametersin order to gain insight into the main drivers of the device performance and their interactions. the screening doe is also guided by a deep physical understanding of the device as well as the modeling of results in order to reduce the complexity ofthe experiments. once the most important factors have been identiﬁed and the approximate opti- mum design point is located, the device response surface is mapped out. this surface describes the quantitative dependence of each response on its driving factors near the optimum design point. even with all the simpliﬁcations that the doe approach affords, we need a reliable testing infrastructure to make it practical (in terms of time, complexity, or setup, and validity of measurement results) to measure the thousands of fabricateddevices to obtain necessary information about their design and process sensitivities. what has allowed luxtera to develop a thoroughly characterized set of devices for the photonic library was our automated wafer scale testing capability, described insect. 8.4. another very important element in being able to develop the best design for each device is a good understanding of the measurement capabilities of the test systems8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 205 utilized. gage studies were run for each type of measurement to understand the capabilities of the test and the errors introduced by variations in measurement. typ-ically, the gage of a measurement was considered capable if it was about an order of magnitude better than the difference between devices that it was intended to detect. 8.3.5 the role of process variability in design selection since process factors often turned out to be the strongest ones that determine the variations in device response, these were also exercised in order to obtain a fullmodel for the device: corner lots were run where process parameters were inten- tionally targeted toward the edges of the normal process distribution. intrinsic pro- cess variations are unavoidable, so to design a robust device, we took into accountnot only the nominal process points but also its normal variations. therefore, the primary goal of component library design was not necessarily to achieve a world- class performance for each component but to ﬁnd a design point with low processsensitivity, while still maintaining sufﬁciently good performance. one trade-off that occasionally emerges when selecting a design is the trade-off between producing excellent performance some of the time and designing for lowvariability, as exempliﬁed in the distributions in fig. 8.14. a device, whose perfor- mance is described using a certain ﬁgure of merit (fom), may have two embod- iments. by way of example, one of these designs has low variability, or processsensitivity (dashed line), whereas the other one has high process sensitivity (dotted line). the process may have large enough variations to produce a device with an excellent ﬁgure of merit in a small number of cases (a hero device) but at the expense of a very wide distribution over all process corners. to be commercially competitive, it was essential that luxteras designs were selected with the purpose of having lowvariability in order to keep the entire population within speciﬁcations. to achieve optimal performance for the device, we can implement process improvements to shift the fom distribution higher (solid line). in the speciﬁc caseof the psgc, these improvements included tightening the depth control of the etch deﬁning the grating features and a smaller linewidth, more accurate lithography fig. 8.14 comparison of the ﬁgure of merit (fom)distributions. solid line : library element optimized forminimal process sensitivity. dotted line : device optimized for hero performance206 t. pinguet et al. process. for all process modiﬁcations or improvements, one important goal is to retain low process sensitivity for the photonic library elements. 8.3.6 design veriﬁcation and device models with an accurate and automated testing capability in hand, we have characterizedeach photonic library element similar to the methodology used for creating transis-tor models for an electronic library. by measuring thousands or tens of thousands of fabricated instances of each device we have veriﬁed device performance across many lots and understood their process sensitivity in depth. the outcome of thedesign veriﬁcation effort is a faithful model that describes the device response as a function of design, process, and environmental factors. once the models have been determined for a library element, it is released for use in a photonic circuit. however, the device development does not necessarily stop here. automated wafer scale testing enables us to determine individual variancecomponents of the device comprising within wafer, wafer-to-wafer, and lot-to-lot variations. this information can point us toward potential process improvement paths. 8.4 design and testing infrastructure: the tools of success 8.4.1 wafer-scale optoelectronic testing beyond the concept of a device library, luxtera has also extended the philosophy of the microelectronics world to the design and testing infrastructure. as discussedabove, the approach taken for the development of the process and the devices would not have been possible without the availability of a similar wafer-scale testing capa- bility to that of the electronics world. the design of grating couplers and the normal coupling of light in and out of the wafers allowed us to use the existing tools and equipment for wafer-scale electrical probing by adding an equivalent ﬁber-basedoptical probe to a standard setup. one of our optoelectronic probestations is shown in fig. 8.15.w eu s e da st h e starting platform a prober made by cascade microtech, which is capable of load-ing 8-inch wafers. the optical probe setup is shown in the inset of the ﬁgure and consists of a ﬁber array (typically 16 ﬁbers, with a combination of single-mode and polarization maintaining ﬁbers) mounted at the end of an arm. the arm is attached toa piezoelectric x-y-z stage. the probestation chuck is used to provide large motion across the wafer, while the piezo stage is coupled to an active analog feedback sys- tem for automated alignment. the feedback signal can be a combination of sum,differences, or multiples of different optical powers coming from the different ﬁbers in the array. we designed an alignment feature that is placed within each chip on the wafer. a single alignment is performed for every wafer loaded and is sufﬁcient8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 207 fig. 8.15 photograph of wafer-scale optical probestation to ensure that any subsequent spot on the wafer can be tested. any combination of wavelength scans and optoelectronic tests (light-current-voltage/liv , s-parameters, photoresponsivity) can be run automatically across an entire wafer. this capability is what has enabled luxtera to approach the development of our device library in the way described in sect. 8.3. without such test automation, cap- turing enough data to obtain statistically relevant information about the response ofthe performance to the design variations would have been impossible. this capa- bility has enabled luxtera to approach the development of our device library in the way described in sect. 8.3without such test automation, capturing enough data to obtain statistically relevant information about the response of the performance to design variations would have been impossible. 8.4.2 design automation tools with the continuous improvement of cmos process nodes has also come theincrease in costs associated with the fabrication of masks and the actual processing in the fab. it is typical for advanced nodes to have costs measured in many millionsof dollars for a single tapeout and even at 130 nm the mask costs are far from neg- ligible. so any error in the design can result in the scrapping of an entire maskset and costing enormous amounts. considering the complexity of vlsi circuits with208 t. pinguet et al. hundreds of thousands or even millions of gates on a single chip, an error is most likely to happen. to prevent this, the electronics industry has heavily invested in the development of software tools to aid designers in creating error-free designs capable of ﬁrst- silicon success. there are three main types of tool categories: – physical design veriﬁcation, i.e., does the layout of the chip break any rules mak- ing it likely that the yield of the chip will be impacted or even that the chip will be non-functional? – layout versus schematic, i.e., does the layout actually match the desired circuit architecture? – simulation, i.e., does the schematic of the circuit provide the expected function- ality, performance, power, etc.? with the capabilities of tight integration of optics and electronics that luxtera developed came also the dangers of incorrect layouts, so we had to develop addi- tional elements to complement existing electronics tools. the complete toolkit of all these is called the pdk or physical design kit, and luxtera created a completeoptoelectronic pdk capable of performing drc (design rule checks), lvs (layout versus schematic), and simulations of optoelectronic systems. our toolkit was based on the initial electronics-only pdk provided by freescale and was subsequentlymodiﬁed to provide the additions. an example of an optoelectronic schematic (in this case an mzi modulator with electrical driver) and its simulated optical eye diagram at 10 gbps is shown in fig. 8.16. fig. 8.16 example of optoelectronic schematic and simulated eye diagram8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 209 without such tools, it would have been inconceivable for luxtera to successfully design and fabricate the chip that is discussed in sect. 8.5. 8.5 example of cmos photonic system to validate the technology platform, we designed, assembled, and tested a technol- ogy demonstration vehicle. we decided to build a wavelength-division-multiplexed (wdm) transceiver that integrates: – four 10 gbps transmitters, which are fed by 4 wdm-signals that are spaced at 200 ghz wavelengths. – a 4-channel wdm-multiplexer (mux) with 200-ghz spacing. – a 4-channel wdm-demultiplexer (demux). – four 10-gbps receivers using ge-pin photodetectors. four external continuous-wave-wdm light sources that are centered at 1,552 nm are used and coupled via grating couplers that serve as optical interface into the chip. the light is routed trough mzi-based modulators. each modulator blockincludes optical biasing elements, integrated ge-monitor photodiodes, and a feed- back loop that stabilizes the operation of the transmitter. this is required to guar- antee operation throughout the operational temperature range of 0–70 ◦c. after modulation the four signals are multiplexed in the interleaver-based wdm–mux, which also contains biasing and monitoring elements as well as control electronics.the multiplexed signals are coupled via the optical interface grating coupler into a polarization-maintaining single-mode ﬁber and transmitted to the wdm-receiver, where an interleaver-based wdm–demux separates the signals and couples intofour ge-pin photodetectors followed by trans-impedance/limiting ampliﬁer cir- cuitry. we also integrated a bist-block (build-in self test) that allows testing of the high-speed performance of the transmitters. the sfi interface was chosen as theelectrical interface. a complete link transmits and receives 4 ×10 gbps bidirectional data streams. eda tools are an integral part of the technology platform. this chip was designed using validated electronic and optical libraries, automated design-rule-checking (drc), and layout-versus-schematic (lvs) veriﬁcation. figures 8.17 and8.18 show a schematic architecture and a top view of the transceiver die highlighting the criticalfunctional blocks. the die has a footprint of 9 ×8m m 2. the die was packaged into a quad-small-form-factor-pluggable (qsfp) module as shown in figs. 8.19 and8.20. the optical connections to the die were made via the optical interface, which consists of a linear array of grating coupler spaced at 250 microns to which a ﬁber array assembly can be bonded. the electrical high-speedsignals are routed to the module edge connector via a ﬂex circuit. the ﬂex circuit also accommodates the dense routing of power and control signals to the die and contains necessary decoupling capacitors as well as a connector to a low-speed pcbthat contains a micro-controller and voltage regulators.210 t. pinguet et al. fig. 8.17 wdm transceiver architecture we tested transmitter and receiver performance and typical results are shown in figs. 8.21,8.22, and 8.23. the receiver subsystem consisting of grating coupler, demux, waveguide routing, and that overall ﬁrst generation receiver achieved a sensitivity of approximately −10 dbm at ber = 1e-12 with the ge-pin receivers achieving a sensitivity of −17 dbm. link tests were conducted with transmitters8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 211 fig. 8.18 wdm transceiver die shot fig. 8.19 wdm transceiver packaged conﬁgured to emit average powers of −5 dbm per channel with −15 db cross- talk from adjacent wdm-channels, and error-free bidirectional transmission was obtained. all module-level and subsystem-level test results are in close agreementwith system-level simulations conducted during the chip design phase and validate the chosen design ﬂow. due to the lack of integrated light sources this demonstrator is of no commer- cial value. in general the light source is of critical importance for silicon photonics applications and has been delaying the introduction of commercial products. it is not a coincidence that the detector-only optical functionality of silicon has resultedin commercial success in cmos-image sensors a long time ago. historically, new applications and markets in the photonic industry have often emerged whenever new or critically improved light sources became available. for212 t. pinguet et al. fig. 8.20 wdm transceiver in test board cmos-photonics to become more than a curiosity a convincing solution to the light source problem is required. a cheap, volume-capable laser is required that can be integrated with the cmos-photonics chip and meets the optical power requirementsset by the applications. we believe that this is an engineering problem rather thena science problem and that all critical pieces required to build such a laser are in existence. fig. 8.21 wdm transmitter multiplexed optical output spectrum8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 213 fig. 8.22 wdm transmitter typical

for optoelectronic integration. we followed a cmos-ﬁrst approach by inserting enabling process modules into a baseline cmos-process ﬂow and by attemptingto minimize the number of process modiﬁcations and adjustment that are required to maintain the performance of the baseline process. a critical input into the fab- rication process is the starting soi substrate, which needs to be selected in a wayto enable optical devices with sufﬁcient optical performance to address the targeted optoelectronic applications and which has a direct impact on the integration of the cmos modules. to enable the photonic devices we integrated a trench etch module to form all passive devices, implant modules to form modulators, and a germanium module for light detection. the cmos photonics technology platform consists of – photonic and electronic libraries – design veriﬁcation and layout veriﬁcation tools and processes– system modeling tools – fabrication of the photonically enabled cmos-wafers – wafer-level optical and optoelectronic device and system testing– module-level photonic packaging and testing. there is a lot of focus within the scientiﬁc and research and development com- munity on the optical devices and their fabrication. we want to emphasize theimportance of design and veriﬁcation tools to create higher level optoelectronic systems that can take advantage of the monolithic integration of the optical devices. we have uniﬁed the design ﬂow for optical and electrical cmos devices in thisplatform. we followed a systematic process to develop, characterize, and integrate a pho- tonic library into a chip design ﬂow. all photonic devices were developed with a doe-based design methodology that exercises design and process factors during development and device veriﬁcation. the photonic device library with device mod-els is available as input for system designers to model higher-level systems. the library is integrated into a state-of-the-art eda tool. wafer-level testing played a crucial rule in the development of the photonic device library as it allowed auto-mated optical testing of the device library elements. the enabling photonic device for wafer-level testing is the grating coupler, which also forms the optical i/o for all optoelectronic systems. we have demon-strated testing of integrated sub-systems on wafer. from an application perspec- tive cmos photonics accomplished monolithic receiver integration by inserting a germanium module into the process ﬂow. besides enabling high-speed receivers italso provides optoelectronic systems with the critical ability to monitor the light ﬂow and control the operation of higher level subsystems such as modulators and multiplexers.8 cmos photonics: a platform for optoelectronics integration 215 a demonstration vehicle (40 gbps wdm transceiver) exercised the complete ﬂow covering die design, design veriﬁcation, fabrication, wafer test, and moduletest and validated the luxtera cmos photonics technology platform. acknowledgments the development of this technology was truly a team effort for which credit goes to the whole luxtera team as well as our foundry partner freescale. the technology demon-strator was built under the darpa-program electronic and photonic integrated circuit (epic)program. we also would like to thank neil berglund for critical input and guidance on the pathfrom

electronic circuit with microelectronics tools on large-size wafers are addressed. this full integration enables improvement of either the functionalities of the electronic circuits or theminiaturization of optical functions. the above-integrated-circuit fabrication is pre- ferred to a combined fabrication process, with two options ruled by thermal con- straints. the high-temperature option is based on wafer bonding on an opticalsilicon-on-insulator module, and the low temperature option relies on the heteroge- neous integration of iii–v devices. compatible with these options, several silicon- based building blocks have been developed, such as slightly etched rib waveguideswith low propagation loss (0.1 db/cm), crystalline and amorphous waveguides, efﬁ- cient ﬁber couplers, a 42-ghz ge integrated photodetector, and a 15-ghz si mod- ulator. using molecular bonding of inp dice and processing in a microelectronicsenvironment, inp laser sources have been achieved on silicon. 9.1 introduction silicon-based photonics has generated an increasing interest in recent years, mainly for optical telecommunications or for optical interconnects in microelec- tronic circuits [ 1]. the development of elementary passive and active compo- nents (input/output couplers, modulators, passive functions, and photodetectors) has reached such a performance level that the integration challenge of silicon photonics with microelectronic circuits has been discussed in the literature [ 2] and active optics cables are now produced. the rationale of silicon photonics is the reduction of the cost of photonic systems through the integration of photonic components and an j.-m. fedeli, b. ben bakir, and l. grenouillet ( b) cea-leti, minatec, 38054 grenoble, france d.

longer term, the enhancement of eic characteristics with the introduction of optics inside a high-performance circuit. to achieve such a high level of photonic function integration, the light has to be strongly conﬁned in submicron waveguides with a large refractive index contrast ( /delta1n∼2 typically) between the core and the surrounding environ- ment. when one wants to integrate an electronic circuit with some photonic func- tions in order to build a photonic electronic integrated circuit (peic), the question of how to combine the photonic with the electronic parts is raised. the goal of thischapter is to discuss the routes of convergence of photonics and electronics on large wafers and to present the building blocks developed in our laboratories to address this challenge. 9.2 ways to integrate photonics devices on an electronic wafer silicon photonics has been developed thanks to the development of high-quality speciﬁc silicon-on-insulator (soi) wafers. the buried oxide thickness was designed to be thick enough to reduce any optical leakage to the substrate. it is compara-ble to silica-on-silicon technology, which is in production today. here, the silicon substrate acts only as a convenient and cheap substrate and the difference resides in the waveguiding layer that is made on silicon. in the 1990s, this soi technologywas pioneered by bookham with waveguide dimensions typically in the micrometer range and is now in production by kotura for their different products. the ratio- nale for highly integrated photonics is the reduction of the cost and the increase inperformance by merging the photonics and the control electronics parts. different integration technology options are presented in fig. 9.1. each one has its own merit and will be discussed. the hybrid solution consists in assembling eics with silicon option 2 combined front-end fabricationoption 1  photonic layer at the last levels ofmetallizations withback-end fabrication option 3 backside  fabrication fig. 9.1 integration routes9 photonics and electronics integration 219 photonic integrated circuits (pics) by the well developed ﬂip-chip technique. the silicon photonics circuit is considered as a board where the different circuits areattached (laser diodes, drivers, photodetectors, transimpedance ampliﬁers, etc ...). however, full integration offers a reduced assembly and packaging cost reduction and will be only considered in this chapter. considering the cross-section of the eic shown in fig. 9.1, three options can be considered: •the ﬁrst option is often called three-dimensional (3d) or above integrated circuit (aic) integration, where the photonic layer is realized at the metallization levels with back-end of the line technology (beol). •the second option combines the fabrication of transistors and the photonic devices at the front-end fabrication level (feol). •the third option takes advantage of the ﬂat surfaces at the back-side of eic wafers, but requires double-side processing. 9.2.1 above ic fabrication with above ic fabrication, the thermal budget is limited to 400◦c in order to avoid any degradation of the eic, mostly of the interconnections underneath. two routes were developed, considering the need of introducing devices fabricated with a high-temperature process or using only low temperature fabrication. the high-temperature route takes advantage of the well developed wafer bonding technology. the second one aims to process all the photonic devices with a low temperature and uses the efﬁcient iii–v technology. 9.2.1.1 soi photonics and electronic wafer bonding using the wafer bonding technique, one can introduce a photonic layer at some level in the processing steps of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (cmos) technology. since the ﬁrst metal layers are too densely packed and thin, introduction at the upper metal layers must be considered. the process is described in fig. 9.2. after fabrication of the last metal layer in an advanced electronic process, a pla- narized surface can be formed by ﬁrst coating the surface with a deposited oxide, and then perform chemical mechanical polishing (cmp). on a separate soi wafer,a photonic circuit is fabricated with silicon waveguides and electro-optical com- ponents. after cladding the optical wafer with oxide and planarization with cmp, perfect cleaning of both wafers facilitates their molecular bonding at room tem-perature. the substrate of the soi wafer is then removed by mechanical grinding, followed by a chemical etching of si in order to stop at the buried oxide (box) inter- face. then, the electro-optical and electrical components are connected by means ofsilica etching followed by the metal deposition and etch. the alignment between the electrical and the photonic wafers can be performed with present equipment as precise as ±2μm. therefore, the design rules between the metal layers have to take220 j.-m. fedeli et al. box  si substratewaveguidemodulator photodetector cmos si substrate cmos si substratemetallizationboxsi substrate cmos si substrate cmos si substratebox cmos si

this alignment margin into account. this technique is often called 3d heterogeneous integration because the electric part is separated from the photonic part without anysilicon surface waste at the transistor level. with this approach, any microelectron- ics technologies can be used for the electrical parts, monocrystalline silicon optical functions such as modulators or ge photodetectors as well as iii–v components can be embedded in the photonic layer and bonded above the integrated circuit. as a demonstration, on a soitec soi wafer with a 400-nm thick si layer, we have processed a silicon rib network with cavities ﬁlled with germanium. after as i o 2cladding deposition, the optical wafer was carefully polished and bonded onto a cmos wafer coming from stmicroelectronics before substrate removal(fig. 9.3). a sem cross-section observation did not reveal any interface defect between the two sio 2layers and any degradation of either the metal or the photonic layers (fig. 9.4). this wafer bonding technique is a very promising way to integrate a photonic layer into cmos technology. the wafer bonding technique is mature and the intra connections (3d techniques) between levels of metallization are well addressed bythe electronics community. however, the main challenge that needs to be faced is the bonding cost issue compared to the combined fabrication approach. 9.2.1.2 heterogeneous integration as long as the temperature is constrained so that it does not exceed 400 ◦c, a pho- tonic layer can be deﬁned above the transistors and the dielectric/metallic levels.the obvious way to introduce such a photonic layer is to include it in the same manner as an additional metallic layer in the process ﬂow, i.e., on the top of the stacked layers that have been used for the electrical interconnect. for the passive9 photonics and electronics integration 221 fig. 9.3 rib waveguides with splitters, corner mirrors, andrectangular cavities ﬁlledwith germanium on a

germanium ge cavitysilicon  metallisations sio 2  circuitry, one has to rely on a deposited waveguide process, such as sion, sin, or hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer, which has a high-contrast index. for the active parts, efﬁcient iii–v compounds materials can be bonded and processed to form lasers, modulators and photodetectors coupled to the silicon passive circuitry.like the introduction of copper in a microelectronics circuit, contamination has to be controlled and some parts of the process have to take place in a dedicated part of the microelectronics clean room. after the amorphous silicon waveguide circuitry isdeﬁned, a silica deposition followed by a cmp planarization and a surface function- alization are performed. active heterostructures grown on inp substrates are bonded on silicon without the need of precise alignment. the inp substrates of these diesare then removed by selective chemical etching and further processing steps are performed that lead to sources and detectors connected to the metallic interconnects of the integrated circuit.222 j.-m. fedeli et al. 9.2.2 combined fabrication the integration of optical functions that are compatible with microelectronic pro- cess technologies presents new and powerful potentialities for integrated circuits. however, a monolithic integration of dissimilar functions still remains a difﬁculttechnological challenge. with a combined integration scheme, the new components (waveguides and optoelectronic components) have to be fabricated aside from the transistors. so the process has to take into account both constraints for the elec-tronics and the photonics such as withstanding thermal treatment. starting with the substrate, photonics components need a separation of larger than 1 μm between the waveguide core (thickness between 200 and 400 nm for a submicron waveguide) andthe silicon substrate to avoid light leakage. on the contrary, cmos technologies are based on either a bulk type substrate or an soi type with thin box and silicon layers (50 nm of si on a 145-nm box, for example). so, as regards the microlectronicstechnology used, different choices of substrate can be relevant (fig. 9.5). as the thickness of the box is deﬁned by the photonic parts, a modiﬁed cmos technology can be developed using an soi substrate with around a 1- μm-thick box and a thick photonics box si substratesi upper layer  photonics box photonics area electronics box bulk electronics area photonics boxsoi electronics area  photonics area cba fig. 9.5 substrates for combined fabrication9 photonics and electronics integration 223 silicon layer (fig. 9.5a). by engineering the soi fabrication, a localized thick box area for the photonics area can coexist with a thinner box for the electronics area(fig. 9.5b). however the cost could be a stopper. another option, in order to use bulk electronics technology, consists in deﬁning a photonics area on a bulk substrate where a buried oxide or a cavity (silicon on nothing) is formed under a silicon layer(fig. 9.5c). to combine both process steps, the thermal budget rules the sequence of fabrication. an analysis of the process ﬂow for both technologies reveals that high temperatures (≈1,000 ◦c)are necessary for the shallow trench isolation and implant activation as well as for the optimization of waveguide losses. medium temperature (≈700◦c)steps are used for gate oxide, implant anneal and for active photonic layers like a silicon-doped region for modulation and ge epitaxy for photodetec-tion. beol technology is used for metallization on both, with an obvious savings in process steps. so combining steps for the electronic and the photonic parts in order to avoid redundant steps is feasible on an optical soi substrate, leading to aphotonic soi technology (psoi), as successfully demonstrated by luxtera. how- ever, some process steps like higher temperature annealing of material grown at a medium temperature to improve its structural property are forbidden with a conse- quence of reduced performance. as the microelectronic process is very mature, the introduction of a new photonic part in a large cmos foundry requires a lot of effortfor changing the process. low and medium scale ic foundries are more suitable to accept such modiﬁcations, as they can differentiate their process and address new markets. moreover, this combined fabrication is ﬁxed for one particular electronictechnology and not compatible with other technologies (sige, ssoi, goi, etc.). as an example, a typical 130-nm cmos technology suitable for 10-ghz components may not be suitable for 40-ghz devices, due to limitations in transistor performanceor voltage for ampliﬁers and drivers. 9.3 back-side fabrication fabrication of a photonic layer on the back side of the eic can be considered anddeveloped thanks to through-silicon vias (tsv). after electronics circuit fabricationon the front side, connections through the substrate (100–200 μm thick typically) allow using the back side of the wafer as another substrate for integration of a different technology (sensors, mems, photonics, etc.). then the solutions for aicintegration described in section 9.2.1 with either wafer bonding or low tempera- ture processing are applicable. so the main challenge lies in the ability of forming tsv with a high aspect ratio (depth versus width). a low ratio limits the frequencyoperation in the mhz range, which is incompatible with applications of silicon pho- tonics for communications or optical interconnects with operation in the 10-ghz range. however, for other applications like sensing, the circuit can be connected byﬂip-chip on a board, leaving the back side accessible for the elements to be detected (biomolecules, gases, ...) or for assembly with microtubes (microﬂuidics, lab-on-a chip,....).224 j.-m. fedeli et al. 9.4 passive photonic circuitry 9.4.1 guided structures according the integration schemes, soi or amorphous photonic structures should be considered to guide, turn, split, and distribute optical signals. 9.4.1.1 silicon-on-insulator devices the propagation of the light in a silicon circuit can be done using either rib (partial etching of the silicon ﬁlm) or strip (full etching of the silicon ﬁlm down to the buried oxide ﬁlm) waveguides. the latter allows achieving the highest compactness of theoptical mode but propagation losses are higher than those obtained with rib struc- tures. numerous studies have been done on both kinds of waveguides. most of the strip waveguides studied in the literature have a height of about 220 nm and a widthlower than 500 nm to have single-mode propagation [ 3–5]. these waveguides allow reaching a very high optical mode conﬁnement and a very low crosstalk between neighboring waveguides separated by 1 μm. such a strip structure is often used to deﬁne optical ﬁber couplers based on an inverted taper [ 6,7] and also for the hetero- geneous integration of active iii–v material for the provision of an optical sourceon silicon [ 8]. however, they suffer from a high-propagation-loss level induced by the lithography and etching processes and the difﬁculty in reducing these losses to a negligible level. rib waveguides are mainly used in the realization of silicon-based optoelectronic devices, such as optical modulators, photodetectors, switches, etc., and also to prop- agate the light for a long distance on a silicon chip. indeed, rib soi waveguidesare much less sensitive to scattering losses due to the low interaction between the optical mode and the side-wall roughness [ 9].typically, the height and width of such a waveguide are about 400 and 600 nm, respectively, and the etching depthis adjusted to have a single-mode and low loss propagation. propagation losses as low as 0.1 db/cm have been obtained using a slightly etched rib waveguide (etching depth: 70 nm) [ 10]. such a low loss level has been reached by performing speciﬁc process steps to reduce the sidewall roughness, which consists of a 10-nm thermal oxidation at 1100 ◦c, followed by a de-oxidation, and followed again by a second oxidation. vacuum hydrogen annealing can also be used to reconstruct the silicon edges before thermal oxidation. from the rib geometry, compact 90◦turns and beam splitters can be deﬁned (fig. 9.6a). to make a direction change of the light, a corner mirror is preferred in comparison to a bend for which the curvature radius has to be large enough to avoid light radiation toward the silicon slab. a corner mirror is formed by fully etching thesilicon guide at a 45 ◦angle down to the bottom silicon oxide layer. the theoretical and experimental losses are 0.1 db and less than 0.5 db, respectively [ 11]. the loss can be reduced by improving the ability to vertically etch the silicon waveguidewithout roughness. to split the light, several possibilities are available: multimode9 photonics and electronics integration 225 si sio 2 cea/leti (a)14 µm8 µmsi (b)sio 2 fig. 9.6 3d-ﬁnite-difference time-domain (fdtd) simulations and scanning electron microscope views of ( a) a corner mirror and ( b) a compact t-splitter based on rib waveguides interferometer (mmi), y-junction, and star couplers, for example. mmi splitters are rather long for rib waveguides and y-junction splitters are difﬁcult to fabricate because of their small tip. low loss and compact t-splitters have thus been con-ceived to be compatible with the minimum size of the deep-uv lithography equip- ment (fig. 9.6b). such a splitter is very compact (8 μm wide and 16 μm long) and the theoretical and experimental excess losses are 0.2 and 0.5 db, respectively [ 11]. such rib structures allow deﬁning passive optical links to distribute light everywhere on a silicon chip [ 11,12]. in future photonic circuits, both strip and rib waveguides will be used: strip for ﬁber coupler and rib for optoelectronic devices, for example. to harmonize such a circuit, optical transitions from strip to rib waveguides and vice versa have to be deﬁned. an example is given in figs. 9.7and9.8. the optical transition from a rib waveguide (height =390 nm, width =420 nm and etching depth =170 nm) to a strip waveguide (height =220 nm, width = 460 nm) has been designed, fabricated using deep-uv lithography and character- ized at the wavelength of 1.55 μm. the length of the transition is 50 μm, which is long enough to avoid guided mode mismatch. furthermore, the etching depth ofthe rib waveguide (170 nm) is chosen to perfectly reach the strip waveguide height. theoretically, such a transition is lossless (determined by fdtd simulation). exper- imentally, losses are lower than 0.1 db in the wavelength range between 1.45 and1.6μm[13]. passive photonic structures are becoming more and more well-deﬁned and impressive results have been obtained to guide, turn, split, and distribute light on asoi substrate. this technology can be considered in several integration approaches.226 j.-m. fedeli et al. l = 50 µm 420 nm waveguide height: 390 nm etching depth: 170 nm460 nm waveguide height: 220 nmtip size: 120  nm

the low temperature processing integration option, amorphous silicon (a:si) ﬁlms were deposited by a capacitively coupled plasma reactor, with a rf exci- tation frequency (13.56 mhz). the power can be tuned from 30 to 1200 w andthe operating pressure can be varied from 0.2 mtorr to a few torr. all ﬁlms were deposited at temperatures lower than 400 ◦c to avoid damage to the interconnect layers. tetraethyl orthosilicate (teos) was used as the precursor for oxide deposi- tion and a silane/h 2mixture for the amorphous silicon. by monitoring the power, the index of the layer was adjusted to be close to the monocrystalline si one: n=3.4913 atλ=1310 nm and n=3.4633 at λ=1,550 nm. sheet optical guided losses were measured during the fabrication process using a prism coupling technique (met- ricon 5010) at λ=1.3 and 1.55 μm. by optimising the h 2/silane ratio in the deposition chamber, silicon ﬁlms with losses as low as 0.2 db/cm at λ=1.55μm9 photonics and electronics integration 227 fig. 9.9 amorphous si waveguide withresonating disk asi:h diskasi:h waveguide after 350◦c annealing were deposited on silicon wafers covered with 1 μmo f teos. deep-uv 193 or 248 nm lithography with or without a hard mask and hbr silicon etching were used to deﬁne the waveguide and basic passive functions foroptical links (fig. 9.9). a 1- μm thick sio 2oxide layer was deposited to provide an upper cladding. measurements were performed at a spectral range between 1.25 and 1.65μm. results are compared to previous soi waveguide data [ 14] and the losses are comparable to that of an soi waveguide. we notice that for this a:si waveguide, the losses are respectively equal to 5 and 4 db/cm for the wavelengths of 1,300 and 1,550 nm. we can consider that these losses are essentially due to the diffrac-tion phenomenon resulting from the side wall roughness of the waveguide. for the waveguide of 800 nm width, the losses become very weak, lower than 1 db/cm for wavelengths close to 1,300 nm and tend toward the values of a planar waveguidefor both types of waveguides (with or without thermal annealing at 350 ◦c). this shows that the material has a good stability in time. the most important features for a:si circuitry is the easy possibility to pile up layers and therefore to open up new design concepts or to ease designs such as crossings or coupling. however, the main limitation is due to the limited silicon processing that can be used (lack of ionimplantation for doping, silicide, etc.) 9.4.3 optical couplers the coupling of submicron photonic devices and a single-mode ﬁber (mode diame-ter=10μm) is a real challenge due to their optical mode mismatch. several strate- gies are being studied to overcome this issue using either spot size converters [ 6,7] or grating couplers [ 15–19]. the main objective is to adapt the mode sizes between a silicon-based waveguide and a single-mode ﬁber. 9.4.3.1 grating couplers for several years, grating couplers have been studied for coupling light from and to a submicron waveguide. the main advantages of such a structure are that it is possible228 j.-m. fedeli et al. to inject light anywhere on an optical circuit and not only at the chip edges, contrary to tapers. thus, polished facets and anti-reﬂection coatings are no longer necessary.they can also be used to couple light in every kind of strip or rib waveguide geome- tries and using any materials, especially silicon-based materials (si, a-si, si 3n4, etc.) [ 15–18]. furthermore, grating couplers can be used to carry out wafer-level testing of photonic devices. this point is crucial for application developments. in the following, theoretical and experimental results for silicon and silicon nitride grating couplers [ 20] are given at the wavelength of 1.31 μm for te polarization (fig. 9.10). the coupling efﬁciency depends on the bottom and top cladding silica layer thicknesses as well as the silicon-based ﬁlm thickness. in general, the approach used for the related optimization is based on a differential analysis allowing thedetermination of the optical ﬁeld under the grating for the input plane wave [ 18]. for the two examples presented in fig. 9.10, the wavelength is 1.31 μm and the duty ratio is 50%. the periods of the silicon (380-nm-thick silicon ﬁlm) and guide bottom cladding si substrateλ top cladding sio2 sio2grating

grating couplers are 430 and 1 μm, respectively, and the etching depths are 70 nm (slightly etched) and 300 nm (fullyetched), respectively. the resonance angle is chosen to be close to 10 ◦for both couplers. the coupling efﬁciencies measured under both silicon and silicon nitride grating couplers are higher than 50 and 60%, respectively, for te polarization at the wave- length of 1.31 μm. similar results can also be achieved at a wavelength of 1.55 μm. furthermore, the angular and wavelength tolerances are higher than 3◦and 20 nm, respectively, for both conﬁgurations. by optimizing all layer thicknesses, etching depth, grating geometry, etc., an insertion loss lower than 1 db in the telecom wave- length range can be achieved [ 2]. the remaining drawbacks of grating couplers are a limited optical bandwidth and their high polarization-dependence. 9.4.4 efﬁcient and polarization insensitive in-plane fiber couplers direct in-plane light coupling from a single-mode ﬁber (mode diameter of 10 μm) into a submicron silicon waveguide is rather difﬁcult because of the weak overlapbetween the waveguide mode and the ﬁber mode. furthermore, another issue is the polarization management. depending on their cross-section (waveguide height, width, and etching depth), silicon waveguides are generally highly birefringent, and on the other hand, the polarization in ﬁber-based networks is unpredictable and varies continually with time. the design of an interface building block that enhanceslight-coupling for all polarization states is therefore a critical issue. an alternative approach to grating couplers, already extensively discussed in the literature [ 21,22], is to use a spot-size converter that transforms gradually the silicon waveguide mode into a wider mode supported by a low-index-contrast waveguide (such as polymers or oxides) and that properly matches a lensed ﬁber [ 2,3], as described in fig. 9.11. for the common cases where soi waveguides exhibit a large aspect ratio, silicon couplers are targeted to operate in a single polarization regime (te, in particular). as it is discussed below, for speciﬁc designs, a high-coupling efﬁciency could be attained for both te/tm polarizations. the coupling scheme is presented in fig. 9.11. the design consists of a tapered nano-wire collector embedded in a low index contrast injector that adiabatically transforms the lensed-ﬁber mode into a highly conﬁned mode. a silicon strip waveg-uide of 500 nm width and 220 nm thickness is tapered down to 80 nm by means of deep uv-193 nm lithography and rie etching techniques. the linear variation of the waveguide width is carried out over a length ranging between 200 and 300 μm, depending on the device design. a 3.5- μm-thick layer of silicon rich oxide (siox) is then deposited by pecvd. the amount of silicon nanocrystals in the layeris tailored to obtain a refractive index around 1.6, i.e., close to that of the ﬁber cores. then, the thick layer is partially etched (∼1.5μm)to form a rib-waveguide shaped injector. the unit is encapsulated in silica, and ﬁnally planarized by meansof cmp.230 j.-m. fedeli et al. fig. 9.11 3d representation of the ﬁber coupler. insert:nomarsky image of thesilicon nano-tip this coupling mechanism is based on a phase-matching condition of the funda- mental modes of the soi waveguide and the siox injector (for the sake of clarity, only the te polarization case is presented). figure 9.12 shows the operating princi- ple of the soi adiabatic taper structure. the te effective indices of the supermodes of the entire structure, as well as the effective indices of the local modes, whichare the modes of the uncoupled waveguides, are plotted versus silicon waveguide width. when the local mode of the injector excites a supermode and that supermode is transformed adiabatically over the phase matching region, light is coupled to thesilicon waveguide. at the tip, the supermode ﬁeld proﬁle is delocalized from the soi waveguide core. this delocalization of the ﬁeld proﬁle ensures a strong overlap with the local mode of the injector. in addition, almost the entire ﬁeld resides in the fig.

index to be close to that of the ﬁber, which results in negligible scattering losses and back reﬂections. figure 9.13 presents simulation results of a ﬁber-coupler with a 300 μm taper length, performed at 1.55 μm (te case). the ﬁeld patterns clearly demonstrate that the ﬁber mode easily penetrates into the “injector part” of the device. this gentle transition is ensured thanks to the similar shapes and index contrasts between thelensed-ﬁber and the injector. the mode is then evanescently coupled into the soi waveguide along the taper length. it should be pointed out that this design is very robust with respect to variations induced by the fabrication processes. as a relevantexample, simulations results indicate insigniﬁcant changes of the coupling efﬁcien- cies for a taper length variation ranging between 200 and 300 μm. less than 1 db coupling losses were calculated over the 1,500–1,600 nm wavelength range. for the optical characterization of the fabricated devices, a single-mode lensed ﬁber with a mode ﬁeld diameter mfd =3μm was used as an input reference. the experimental results (fig. 9.14) demonstrate an excellent agreement with the numerical forecasts. the coupling efﬁciency remains high in a broad spectral range: the bandwidth at 1 db is around 100 nm ( >300 nm at 3 db) for both te and tm polarization states. future developments will focus on the increase of the cross- section of the injectors in order to achieve an efﬁcient coupling with cleaved single- mode ﬁbers (mfd ∼10μm)and on the fabrication of silicon v-grooves at the input for packaging purposes. 9.4.5 silicon-based optical modulator the optical signal generated by an integrated source has to be encoded to ensureinformation transmission at high data rates ( >10 gbit/s). this operation can be done in the silicon chip. indeed, for several years now, impressive progress has232 j.-m. fedeli et al. fig. 9.14 measured coupling efﬁciencies for both polarizations been obtained on silicon-based optical modulators. several physical effects have been investigated: electro-optical effects in strained silicon [ 23] and in bulk silicon- germanium [ 24] or the quantum-conﬁned stark effect in sige/ge quantum wells [25] have been recently demonstrated. however, most of the fast modulators inte- grated in a silicon waveguide are based on free carrier concentration variations [26–36]. the ﬁrst silicon modulator achieving a 1-ghz bandwidth was based on carrier accumulation in a mos capacitor [ 26,27]. carrier injection has been widely studied, with record data rates of 18 gbit/s [ 28,29]. the most impressive results have been achieved using a carrier depletion phenomenon [ 30–36]. indeed, as it is a unipolar effect, it is intrinsically fast ( >10 ghz). furthermore, as a reverse bias is used to sweep carriers out, the electrical current is very low, which leads to low power dissipation. carrier depletion can be achieved in either a pn or pin diode using either sige/si modulation-doped quantum wells or all-si doped layers integrated in a soi rib microwaveguide. the principle is the following: at equilibrium (without voltage bias), carriers pro- vided by a doped layer are conﬁned in the microwaveguide. when a reverse bias is applied to the diode, the electrical ﬁeld sweeps the carriers out of the active region,which is responsible for local refractive index variations. this latter effect induces a phase shift of the guided wave. an interferometer such as a mach – zehnder inter- ferometer, a fabry – perot microcavity or a microring resonator is used to convertthe phase modulation into an intensity modulation. the main frequency limitation of such a modulator is due to a resistance – capac- itor product limitation. indeed, the reverse biased active diode is a capacitance (c) in series with an access resistance (r)due to the doped silicon regions between the metal and the active region. the device is electrically equivalent to a low pass ﬁlter, with a cut-off frequency of 1/(2πrc):rand chave to be minimized to9 photonics and electronics integration 233 increase the cut-off frequency. as the modulator capacitance is directly proportional to the active region area, this area has to be as low as possible. resistances mainlydepend on access region geometries and doping levels. however, as the optical loss increases with doping level, a trade-off has to be found between low optical loss and low electrical resistance. figure 9.15 presents an example of an all-silicon optical modulator using carrier depletion variation. it is based on reverse bias pin diode where a thin p +doped slit, localized in the intrinsic region, is inserted in the middle of the rib waveguide. withsuch a structure, a good overlap between the optical mode and the p-doped slit is then obtained to reach good modulation efﬁciency [ 30]. under a reverse-bias, holes located in the slit at equilibrium are sweep out with a rise time lower than 2 ps [ 36]. the phase shifter structure based on a lateral pin diode (fig. 9.15) allows a low capacitance thanks to a low diode area (phase shifter length ×waveguide height). as a large part of the active structure is non-intentionally doped, the optical loss isthen reduced. the optical modulator was fabricated on an undoped 200-mm-diameter soi sub- strate with a 1- μm-thick box layer. the silicon rib waveguide width was 660 nm, the rib height was 400 nm, and the etching depth was 100 nm, leading to a single- mode propagation of the guided mode at a wavelength of 1.55 μm. the doping concentrations in the p- and n-doped regions of the pin diode were 10 18cm−3.a 100-nm-wide p-doped slit, with a doping concentration of about 1018cm−3was inserted in the intrinsic region. the silicon modulator was based on an asymmet-ric mach – zehnder interferometer, as illustrated in fig. 9.16. the phase shifter was inserted in both arms over a length of 4 mm, and coplanar waveguide metallic fig. 9.15 schematic view of a silicon phase shifter based on a p+doped region in a lateral pin diode fig. 9.16 asymmetric mach – zehnder interferometer with the active region localized in both arms234 j.-m. fedeli et al. fig. 9.17 (a) experimental transmission of the modulator as a function of the wavelength, for several reverse bias voltages. ( b) normalized optical response of the modulator as a function of the rf signal frequency electrodes were used to bias one arm [ 30]. the whole process is fully compatible with microelectronics technology and could be transferred to high-volume micro- electronic manufacturing. very low values of the reverse current ( −2μaa t−10 v) are obtained, which ensures low electrical power dissipation in dc conﬁgurations. the transmission of the optical modulator is obtained using a tuneable laser around 1,550 nm for te polarization. the normalized output spectra of the modulator were measured fora bias from 0 to −10 v (fig. 9.17a). the effective index variation induced in the phase shifter is due to hole depletion, which creates a red-shift of the spectrum. the insertion loss is as low as 5 db for a 4-mm-long active region. at a given wavelength,a large transmission variation is obtained that leads to a dc extinction ratio larger than 15 db from 0 to −10 v. the normalized optical response as a function of the frequency of the modulator is given in fig. 9.17b. a−3-db cut-off frequency of 15 ghz has been obtained. the speed limitation of the tested device is not due to carrier transport mechanisms, but rather to the electrical supply. 9.5 germanium waveguide photodetectors the last photonic element needed to complete the high-speed optical link is the integrated photodetector. such a component has been available for several yearsfrom the iii–v semiconductor technology on inp and gaas wafers. nevertheless, its integration on large wafers within the mainstream silicon technology requires a hybrid integration approach [ 36–38]. within group iv materials, silicon is transpar- ent throughout the required wavelength range (1.25–1.65 μm) and only pure germa- nium allows light detection up to 1.6 μm[39–41]. basically, the growth of a thick ge layer on si is rather difﬁcult because of the large lattice parameter mismatchbetween si and ge ( ≈4.17 %). to overcome this, a two-step epitaxial growth of ge is used. first, a thin ge layer is grown at low temperature to avoid three-dimensional9 photonics and electronics integration 235 growth and to concentrate most of the dislocations. this ﬁrst step allows a growth at a higher temperature of a thick ge layer with a good structural quality [ 42,43]. the absorption coefﬁcient of such a ge layer is very close to that of bulk ge (∼10,000 cm−1and 5,000 cm−1at 1.31 and 1.55 μm, respectively). a band-gap shrinkage that leads to absorption up to 1.6 μm is then observed. this red shift of the absorption edge is directly related to a tensile strain induced in the ge layer. the measured hole mobility is close to 1,300 v cm−2s−1with a residual carrier density smaller than 1016cm−3. furthermore, the carrier lifetime is estimated to be much higher than the carrier collection time, which avoids the possible recombination of the photogenerated carriers. two kinds of germanium on silicon photodetectors have been demonstrated, including msm (metal-semiconductor-metal) or pin structures: a surface illumi- nated photodetector [ 3–5] and an integrated photodetector in a soi waveguide [44–49]. embedding germanium in a soi waveguide allows monolithic integration in a photonic circuit. furthermore, high responsivity and high bandwidth can be simultaneously obtained for waveguide photodetectors. two integration schemes for the ge photodetectors in soi waveguides can be considered: either evanescent or butt coupling of light from the si waveguide to the ge layer. for both integration methods, the direct coupling allows reducing theabsorption length down to few microns without any considerations on the ge layer thickness. recently, a 42-ghz waveguide ge photodetector has been designed, fabricated, and characterized at a wavelength of 1.55 μm (fig. 9.18)[49]. in such a structure, butt coupling integration has been considered. the rib waveg- uide width and height are 660 and 380 nm, respectively. the etching depth was about110 nm. first, a silicon recess is etched down to a 50-nm-thick silicon layer at the end of the rib waveguide. this recess is locally implanted with phosphorus followed fig. 9.18 schematic view of pin ge diode integrated in a soi waveguide236 j.-m. fedeli et al. by thermal annealing at 1 ,050◦c to form the p+ohmic contact. germanium is then selectively grown by reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition (rp-cvd) in thesilicon recess. a 40-nm-thick ge buffer layer grown at low temperature (400 ◦c)is followed by a 300-nm-thick ge ﬁlm at higher temperature (730◦c)and ﬁnally by a 90-nm-thick p-doped ge layer. an annealing step is performed to reduce the thread-ing dislocation density in the ge layer (estimated to about 5.10 6cm−2). bottom con- tacts are then deﬁned. a 300-nm-thick silicon dioxide (sio 2) layer is deposited onto the wafer using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (pecvd). openingson both top p +and bottom n+regions are patterned in the silicon dioxide and a ti/tin/alcu metal stack is deposited to form metallic contacts. the dark current of the pin ge photodiode (15 μm long and 3 μm wide) is as low as 18 na at a reverse bias of 1 v . that corresponds to a current density of about 60 ma/cm2. this rather low dark current value is the result of the thermal annealing after the epitaxial growth. however, more efforts should be made to reduce it forlow sensing applications. under illumination, photocurrent is generated. the responsivity at a wavelength of 1.55 μm is 0.2 a/w without voltage bias and rapidly increases to about 0.9 a/w at 0.3 v reverse bias to ﬁnally reach 1 a/w at −4 v. the external quantum efﬁ- ciency was about 80%. at −0.5 v, the responsivity reaches 1 a/w at a wavelength of 1.52 μm and is still 0.2 a/w at 1.6 μm (fig. 9.19a). the−3-db cut-off point is at a wavelength of around 1.5 μm. the normalized optical responses as a function of frequency, from 0.1 to 50 ghz, are plotted infig9.19b. the −3-db bandwidths are 12, 28, and 42 ghz at 0, −2, and −4 v biases, respectively. for several years now, impressive results have been obtained on ge waveguide photodetectors. the technological process used to fabricate such a photodetector is fully compatible with technologies developed for microelectronic circuits. future developments will focus on speciﬁc requirements for applications such as high-speed optical links between cores of microprocessors or low cost optical communi- cation systems. fig. 9.19 (a) ge photodiode responsivity as a function of wavelength under 0.5 v reverse bias.

[ 55] and gösele et al. [ 56]. sio 2/sio 2molecular bonding enables good bonding quality without any additional adhesive materials [ 57], which could inhibit efﬁcient optical coupling. furthermore, molecular bonding satisﬁes therequirements better in terms of thermal conductivity and dissipation, transparency at the device working wavelengths and mechanical resistance. sio 2/sio2molecular bonding was chosen since it is fully compatible with both microelectronics (sio 2is a standard material) and the above-ic route in terms of thermal budget (the bonding step occurs at room temperature and the bonding strength can support a thermalbudget of 400 ◦c maximum). however, it requires quasi-perfect interfaces; meaning that surface roughness, defect density, particular contamination, and wafer bowing are critical issues. the required ﬂatness and uniformity can be obtained by use ofcmp. the additional role of cmp is to adjust the thickness of the silicon dioxide cladding layer in order to satisfy the optical coupling conditions. the iii–v part needs much more “care” since dicing/cleaving of the iii–v material can generate alot of particles, and since iii–v epitaxies generally result in emerging defects. the adhesion of the thin sio 2layer deposited on the iii–v compound has also to be well controlled, as well as its roughness. further details on inp-on-si wafer bonding can be found in [ 58]. the smallest die size we have bonded is 1 ×1m m2. a pick and place apparatus can be used to mount the inp die onto the silicon substrate. as mentioned above, the bonding9 photonics and electronics integration 239 fig. 9.21 a1 . 2×1.2 mm2, 200-μm-thick inp die bonded on an optical layer on acmos substrate fig. 9.22 t o pv i e wo fa processed inp heterostructurebonded on silicon passivedevices itself occurs spontaneously at room temperature; however, an annealing at 200◦c for several hours reinforces adhesion. mechanically thinning the die down to 20 μm was performed after bonding without degrading the quality of the remaining bondedmaterial. the remaining inp substrate and the sacriﬁcial ingaas layer can then be chemically and selectively back-etched. the additional post-bonding technologi- cal steps such as polishing show that the assembled inp dice on the si substrate can endure many kinds of mechanical maltreatment without debonding. the bond strength between the die and the substrate was measured using die shear testingequipment. the shear strength is of 5 mpa ±1.4 mpa for a 1-mm 2, 360-μm-thick inp dice. some demonstrations of die bonding are highlighted in figs. 9.21 and9.22. 9.6.2 design and fabrication of inp lasers with microelectronics tools after the bonding of the iii–v heterostructure on 200 or 300 mm diameter eics, the processing for iii–v active devices such as the laser, modulator, and photodetector has to take place inside a microelectronics line. we ﬁrst discuss in this section the main building blocks that are currently developed to achieve this goal and then give240 j.-m. fedeli et al. some examples of inp-based lasers on silicon and investigate in terms of integration which approach will pave the way to a full convergence of photonics and electronics. 9.6.2.1 iii–v process with microelectronics tools the main challenge for the processing of iii–v materials with microelectronics tools can be summarized as contamination, which is overcome with careful cleaning pro-cedures. another issue is the development of iii–v dry etching with large-size wafer equipment. last, but not least, one has also to eliminate the gold-based metals that are usually used to fabricate ohmic contacts on iii–v materials, since gold creates a deep level in silicon and is therefore strongly contaminating from a transistor fabrication viewpoint. to fabricate such lasers on 200 mm wafers, plasma etching of inp and related compounds was investigated on 200-mm processing tools using either hbr, cl 2/h2, or ch 4/h2based chemistries. the results obtained are shown in fig. 9.23.h b r etching using inductively coupled plasma (icp) etching was found to generate no steep proﬁles, but rather 45◦sidewalls (cf. fig. 9.23a). furthermore, trenching was observed. these two results are unsuitable for obtaining good quality factors for thelasers and detrimental for electrical injection, respectively. therefore this kind of chemistry probably needs more optimization. using cl 2/h2chemistry under icp plasma mode, steep proﬁles were achieved, as shown in fig. 9.23b. however, etch- ing rates of around 2 μm/min were observed, which could induced difﬁculties in precisely stopping etching on a given epilayer, particularly for thin epistructures. moreover, etching rates are very sensitive to temperature and the etching qualitywas found to be very sensitive to the iii–v environment (silicon, silicon dioxide), as already reported [ 59]. this can be a problem when processing an inp dice bonded on a silicon substrate whose sio 2versus si fraction at the surface may vary. using ch 4/h2-based chemistry in the rie plasma mode, a 100 nm/min etching rate was achieved, as well as relatively steep proﬁles and smooth surfaces (fig. 9.23c). fur- thermore, the etching results seem not to depend on whether the surface exposed to the plasma outside the dice is sio 2or si, making this kind of chemistry suitable for inp/si laser fabrication. ohmic contacts in the world of iii–v semiconductors are commonly obtained with ti/pt/au and/or ni/ge/au using a lift-off process. as gold is strictly forbidden in silicon microelectronics, and as lift-off processes are not common in cmos fig. 9.23 etching proﬁles obtained on inp-based dice bonded on silicon using ( a) icp hbr plasma, (b) icp cl 2/h2plasma, and ( c)r i ec h 4/h2etching9 photonics and electronics integration 241 foundries, an alternative metals deposition and metals etching process must be used for fully cmos compatible processing. different metallization schemes, such asti/tin/alcu or ni/alcu, are currently being explored, in terms of process and electrical characterization points of view. the former metallization was used for the microdisk device fabrication detailed below. 9.6.2.2 fabry – perot (fp) lasers on silicon among the different kind of lasers that can be fabricated on silicon, one can distin- guish broad area lasers emitting in the milliwatt range and microlasers emitting in the tens of microwatts range dedicated to chip external interconnections or intrachip connections, respectively. as a demonstration of a laser on silicon, simple broad area fp lasers were fabri- cated on silicon by means of die-to-wafer bonding, followed by a iii–v process technology with facet dry etching. ti/pt/au and ni/ge/au/ni/au contacts weredeposited by evaporation and lift-off for the p and n contacts, respectively [ 60]. the 1.55- μm ingaasp/inp lasers run under continuous wave (cw) operation at room temperature with an output power in excess of 4 mw and a threshold current of 108 ma at 15 ◦c. figure 9.24 shows an sem image of such lasers, whose facets were etched with icp cl 2/h2plasma, as well as a spectrum obtained at 15◦c and infrared images recorded in stages from below threshold to above threshold. an overall characteristic temperature of 49 k was derived from l-i curves obtained under pulsed operation at different temperatures. we also obtained such fp laserswith facets deﬁned by ch 4/h2rie plasma etching. compared to previous results these lasers offer the advantages of having etched facets instead of using dicing and facet polishing, the latter being incompatible withcmos, and have better thermal characteristics than what can be obtained with ben- zocylobutene (bcb) as a bonding agent [ 61]. fig. 9.24 sem picture of an ingaasp/inp laser on silicon with icp cl 2/h2etched facets, l- i curves obtained at different temperatures with a spectrum in the inset obtained at 15◦c, and infrared images of the fp laser obtained at different currents242 j.-m. fedeli et al. 9.6.2.3 microdisk lasers on silicon to address intrachip interconnections, microdisk lasers that make use of whispering gallery modes created at their periphery are good candidates, since they are com- pact (disk radius in the 3–10 μm range) and offer potentially low power consump- tion. electrically driven ingaasp/inp microdisk lasers were successfully obtained [62–64] for the demonstration of a full optical point-to-point link on cmos [ 65], within the frame of the european project picmos. fabrication of an electrically driven microlaser was then studied and consists of microdisks with a vertical p-i-n junction. the process started by a contamination analysis of the 200-mm-diameter wafers after the bonding step and the inp substrateremoval, as it was not performed in the same clean room. then a special decontam- ination of the rear face of the wafers was performed, in order to avoid any contami- nation of the chucks of the clean-room equipment. a sio 2hard mask of 100 nm was deposited by pecvd. microdisks were deﬁned with 248-nm deep-uv lithography. special attention has to be given to the optical focus, due to the presence of the dice on a limited area of the wafer. the hard mask is then etched with inp as the stoppinglayer. the partial etching was performed with 200-mm icp equipment using hbr rie, as it was the only one available at that time. a second lithography step followed by an inp etching deﬁned the slab necessary for the bottom contact. then 1.5 μmo f sio 2, which is a low index and electrical isolating material, was deposited in place of the bcb used for planarization in the picmos demonstration. cmp was then performed to get a planar surface with a 400-nm separation from the upper surface ofthe inp disk. even if gold-based contacts have well known properties on inp, cmos processes are not compatible with such a metal (except for back-end metallization) because of contamination risks. ti/tin/alcu contacts were an alternative solution since they allow a low resistive contact. tlm measurements were performed on a trial inp wafer with a 500-nm-thick 5.10 18cm−3n+si doped layer and showed that the contacts were of ohmic types. top and bottom electrodes were formed via openings in the sio 2to the bottom and upper inp n doped surface and by patterning the electrodes after the ti/tin/alcu deposition. figure 9.25 shows the ﬁnal device. light emission produced by continuous wave (cw) electrical injection at room temperature was observed (see figs. 9.26 and 9.27), but optical characterization proved that the structure was not lasing, even in pulsed mode, due to the slanted fig. 9.25 optical top view of am i c r od i s k9 photonics and electronics integration 243 fig. 9.26 pin characteristic for ti/tin/alcu contacts fig. 9.27 light power emission at room temperature244 j.-m. fedeli et al. edges which result in a poor quality factor for whispering gallery operation. never- theless, basic elementary building blocks for the demonstration of a laser sourcecoupled to a silicon waveguide and photodetectors have been demonstrated and fabrication is possible on a 200-mm-diameter si fabrication line. however, more studies such as optimization of the etching process, investigations of temperaturedependency, power range, etc., have to be performed before they can be used in applications 9.7 conclusion several different approaches to the integration of a photonic layer on a cmos circuit have been reported: a combined fabrication at the front end level, the wafer bonding of soi photonic circuit at the back-end level, or low temperature processing of pho- tonic devices either on top metallization or on the back side of the electronic wafer.these different approaches lead to different technologies with their own merits and drawbacks. depending on the applications and the associated fabrication volumes the system designers would be able to choose the best way to make their desiredsystem with the necessary building blocks. with the goal of fabrication with micro- electronics, we developed submicron silicon photonics functions using either sige technology or the inp heterogeneous bonded one. due to the cost and intellectualproperty issues, it is rather difﬁcult to get electronic wafers for research. thus only one demonstration of integration could be achieved, which was the bonding of a soi wafer with a silicon rib waveguide and cavities ﬁlled with germanium abovethe metallization of a dummy cmos wafer. as long as contamination was well controlled with appropriate cleaning process steps, the fabrication of inp devices on top of a silicon wafer with low temperature processes was established with micro- electronics tools. this opens the way to the integration of efﬁcient laser sources as well as photodetectors and modulators. acknowledgments this paper summarizes the work of numerous
